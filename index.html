            <h4>Eric's New Hat</h4>
            <p>
              Eric came in through the back kitchen entrance sporting a fresh addition to his cook’s uniform: a
              just-purchased secondhand chef’s hat. Acquired at a nearby thrift store, it was one of the erect,
              starched-linen types with long vertical folds. Well used it no longer had the crisp white appearance of a
              new hat, but rather a faded and creamy yellow-beige hue. In squared black all caps letters the front of
              the hat's wide elastic band bore the phrase "KISS THE COOK", a curt invitation to any who may chance upon
              facing the hat's occupant.
            </p>
            <p>
              As he prepared for dinner service, Eric appeared both amused and pleased by his new acquisition. And he
              confided to his line-cook brethren, myself included, that he was looking forward to test the effectiveness
              of the hat’s bidding on a certain waitress whose undeniable beauty had always garnered his appreciation.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point during the afternoon I took a glance at Eric’s hat and was struck by an idea. Then, shortly
              before the arrival of the dinner servers, I put my idea into action by plucking a single hair from my head
              and snipping off a small section of beige-colored labeling tape. With both hair and tape concealed in my
              hand, I then approached Eric.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s a great hat Eric,” I said. “but there’s a hair stuck right on the front of it.”
              I then brought my cupped hand up to his hat and lightly tapped in the piece of tape. Lowering my hand I
              then showed him the hair, easily passing for one of his own, before letting it fall to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thanks,” he said, “If that wound up on a plate it could have traumatized someone. Maybe even cost me my
              job”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Very true,” I replied, chuckling at the hyperbole. Then stepped back to review my work. Yes indeed, at
              only a short distance the masking tape was virtually invisible. And though impairing the lettering's
              evenness a bit, was a near perfect match to the hat’s time-worn aspect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The night servers then began to enter the dining room, which was separated from the kitchen by a couple of
              swinging saloon doors. Soon each would be coming into the kitchen and interacting with the cooks as part
              of their work routine. I noticed a slightly stifled grin spread on Eric’s face as the voice of a certain
              undeniably beautiful sever was heard approaching the saloon doors. And as he prepared for the surprised
              giggle, and perhaps even a peck on the cheek, in response to KISS THE COOK; I braced for the very
              different, indeed wholly unpredictable response to:

              Of himself, Musician Richard Strauss was reported to have said: “I may not be a first-rate composer, but I
              am a first-class second-rate composer."
            </p>
            <p>
              Substitute chef for composer and this aptly describes myself. I have worked in many good restaurants and
              learned from some very good chefs. I have also owned a couple of decent restaurants at which I was the
              menu's creator and principle cook, thus chef by default. And once - albeit at a mangy, dying place of
              which I was ashamed to be part of - I even held the esteemed position.
            </p>
            <p>
              But personally I could not care less for the title, nor have ever enthusiastically lobbied for the job.
              Cooking became a vocation more out of immediate opportunity than any career-oriented forethought or
              passion for the craft. Learning to cook well has certainly been a benefit to myself, to those for whom I
              have cooked, and those for whom I have worked. But I have very seldom spent non-working hours studying
              different culinary techniques, and devising ways to produce ever-improved food concepts, as first-rate
              chefs invariably do.
            </p>
            <p>
              And though my cooking/hospality experience (I've done it all) certainly has not made me rich, nor my
              future secure, it has introduced me to many interesting places, circumstances, and people. And,
              embelleshed with an assortment of quotes, simple recipes and chef tips (second-rate, of course) that’s
              what this modest work is about:
              Written snapshots -
              literary small plates - of a first-class second-rate chef.

            <p>I took my first restaurant job at the age of 15. It was at a hole-in-the-wall place called Le Provencal
              in downtown Kirkland, Washington - a city now run amok with tech, inflation and pretense. The exterior was
              just a plain, ground-level rectangle with a charcoal awning and an alley to
              the left that led back to the small, dingy kitchen. Inside the house was nice, though. Two candle lit
              rooms, one for regular dining the other for private parties. Dark wood furniture, wine-colored carpeting.
              Part rustic, part elegance.
            </p>
            <p>The owner, Philipe, was French and spoke with a heavy french accent. The waiters were French, and spoke
              with heavy french accents. There were two chefs. One a 20 something sadist named Larry. The other a chubby
              Mexican called Rios. Another cook, the “salad boy,” was Dave Jepeski. A blonde, lanky guy with a jacked up
              Nova who was always flapping off.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plate washers were a couple of snooty high school senior babes. They worked a small, circular
              commercial dishwasher, and performed menial prep tasks like peeling garlic and potatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              My office was the pot and pan sink - to the immediate right of the chefs, the hot flat top, and gas
              burners. My tools of the trade water, soap and scrubbers. No machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was not a good kid at that stage of my life. A liar, thief, bad student, worse son. And I did drugs.
              Lots of ‘em. But somehow I managed to make it through the job’s first month or so without getting the axe.
              Even though I usually showed up with a dope-addled brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was on call one afternoon, hanging out with a friend who had managed to score some peyote, a yet untried
              experience. I had been on call a couple times before, and they never needed me. I figured they wouldn’t
              this night either. So going along with my friend I scraped the mildewy fuzz off some of the buttons and
              popped ‘em.
            </p>
            <p>
              A little while later I called the restaurant. The owner answered and told me to come in. It was gonna be a
              busy night.

            <p> It was a two mile walk to the restaurant, and I cursed the whole way. I hated the place, hated the work.
              And resented the idea of a good high interrupted. But after doing my first tasks, vacuuming the front and
              setting up the pot and pan area, my mind was still clear. Bad peyote, I supposed. Or not peyote at all.
              Really didn't know.</p>
            <p> Before dinner the service staff was allowed to eat and goof off a bit before resuming work. After
              finishing
              a plate of Daube, a sort of french beef stew, I stepped outside with Jepeski. He pulled out a bag with
              some Colombian Gold in it and stuffed some in a pipe. I told him I popped some peyote buttons earlier but
              nothing was happening. He lit the pipe, inhaled, and offered it to me.</p>
            <p>“Something will happen now," he said, exhaling smoke. We made short work of the bowl and went back in. It
              was good weed. I was nice and stoned and started slogging through my work.</p>
            <p>So how you doin’ kid,” Rios asked, knowing, as all kitchen staff and probably waiters too, that me and
              Jepeski were lit. So what. A little buzz. I could still work.
            </p>
            <p>“I’m doing just...”
              The peyote kicked in.
              “Whaa...?”<br />
              “Yeah, I know kid. Tough question. Just try an' keep up. We gonna need stuff ASAP.”</p>
            <p>Don’t know why - probably shouldn’t have - but I drifted over to Jepeski and told him: “The peyote kicked
              in.” He looked at my face, into my eyes. “Wow, dude. You’re <em>seriously</em> baked. Got any more?”
            </p>
            <p>I was seriously baked.
              And within a few minutes all staff knew I was seriously baked. Flapping Jepeski.</p>
            <p>As one might imagine, a lot of details are gone. But some impressions of the ensuing, surreal hilarity
              remain:
              Repeated barks of "HOT!" just as Larry sent red-glowing pans crashing into the sink scalding my arms;
              freakish smells of burnt butter, frog legs, sauce velout&egrave; and pink detergent blasting up my nose;
              <em>tons</em> of charred, greasy metal needing attention "ASAP!"; senior babes snarking me behind my back;
              french-gibbering waiters peering into my wasted eyes, pleading for <em>le peyot&egrave;</em>....
            </p>
            <p> But I made it. Didn't get canned or even told not to get so baked at work. Just how the placed rolled.
              Going home probably made short work of another bowl with Jepeski in his jacked up Nova.</p>

            <h4>Nancy</h4>
            <p>It was a sunny late summer afternoon. Except for the lone woman seated at a table with a fine veiw of
              Lake Washington, the restaurant was empty. Observing her from the the opposite end of the dining room, the
              young server was struck by her apparent beauty. And by how much she reminded him of Nancy. For most of the
              previous year Nancy and he had been together, as happy as any two could hope to be.</p>
            <p>Prior to his time with Nancy, nearly all of his teen years had been a tragedy of drugs, lying and
              thievery. But during those wasted years he yet managed to keep his french restaurant job, advancing from
              dishwasher to pantry cook. And it was there, shortly after Nancy became employed as a hostess, where they
              met and began a relationship. And as their intimacy solidified her wholesomeness helped to change his
              self-destructive ways. Hence his mind was now clear, his days fruitful, and his future bright. But since
              only a short time had elapsed since Nancy had been compelled to move quite far away, his thoughts were
              distracted, his heart heavy.</p>
            <p>Balancing a filled water goblet upon a circular tray, he approached the solitary customer. The nearer
              proximity revealed traits differing from Nancy, but also confirmed his more distant impression: she was
              indeed beautiful. The shoulder-length of her hair was about the same as Nancy's and cast a similar golden
              sheen, but was styled with shorter, more defined waves. Her eyes a purer, darker blue than the grey-blue
              eyes of Nancy. The contour of her face was, like Nancy's, a pleasing elongated oval, but with a touch more
              prominence to her cheeks and chin. And though still possessing a vibrant youthful bloom, she was clearly
              older than Nancy, perhaps by six or seven years, he thought.</p>
            <p>"Good afternoon," he said, placing the goblet on the table. "How are you?"</p>
            <p>Turning her attention from the gem-sparkling view, she looked directly at him. And after a moment's pause
              smiled warmly and responded:</p>
            <p>"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?"</p>
            <p>"I'm fine," he said, slightly unnerved by the undisguised affection that her steady gaze communicated.
              Following another brief pause and still in the magic of her warm, lovely gaze, he focused back on the job
              at hand:</p>
            <p>"Would you care for anything else at this time?"</p>
            <p>"No. Water will be fine until my friends arrive."</p>
            <p>The thought of her friends' arrival seeming to divert her attention from the server, she resumed looking
              out the window towards the lake. But as he turned to depart, she looked to him once more.</p>
            <p>"Thank you," she said. "You're very sweet."</p>

            <p>Turning to face her he again noted the genuine warmth and affection of her gaze as she held his eyes.</p>
            <p>His equilibrium suddenly shattered, he was yet able to mumble a shy "thanks" before she returned her
              attention to the lake.</p>
            <p>From the moment he met Nancy and indeed throughout their relationship, her presence invariably had a
              mellowing effect on his spirit. This was not a result of blunted interest or want of excitement, but
              rather a manifestation of profound compatibility. Similarly attuned to life and its vagaries they were, by
              extension, naturally attuned to each other. They were close in age and status, enjoyed many of the same
              activities and pleasantries, were alike in temperament, and physically and mentally complimentary. They
              were content together during idleness, play, passion or silence. With Nancy he was always at ease.</p>
            <p>It was a perfect contrast to how he now felt. And walking the length of the dining room to the waiter's
              station, the young server wasn't sure if he could complete the journey without toppling over. His heart
              raced, his limbs trembled, and his suddenly untethered mind reeled in a crazy delirium of alien
              intoxication. He knew nothing of this golden haired beauty, but her unabashed affection and simple
              compliment filled him with an intense blast of confusion and joy.</p>
            <p>Entering the wait station, young server began organizing for evening service when the head waiter
              arrived. Tall, charismatic, and a decade his senior, the head waiter was more than a little intimidating
              to the younger man, who typically was hesitant to initiate any conversation not related to the job. At
              this time, however, he needed to vent some of the emotion surging through his nerves. Hence overcoming his
              accustomed timidity, he paused briefly to compose his rambling thoughts and spoke:
            </p>
            <p>"There's uh, uh, a lady out there. Table 10. Very beautiful. Um, seems to like me."</p>
            <p>Moving to the doorless arch separating the wait station from the dining area, the head waiter peered in
              the direction of the lone customer. Then with an expression of amused disbelief looked back to his
              associate.</p>

            <img id="nan" src="img/nancy.PNG" alt="Nancy">
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"That's Nancy."</p>
            <p><em>"Nancy?</em> Well that's a...."</p>
            <p>"Nancy Wilson"</p>
            <p>"Oh. Nancy Wilson?"</p>
            <p>"Oh come on, you can't be that sheltered. You never heard Magic Man....Crazy On You....Never heard of
              Heart?"</p>
            <p>"<em>Ahh.</em> Well yes. Sure I have. But she, she was really nice....Said I was...."</p>
            <p>"Yeah, well she is really nice. Just who she is. I know her. Sing back up for the band sometimes."</p>
            <p>"Really?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, really. And she really is just nice. Damn kid, what were you thinking...?"</p>
            <p>The young server looked on as the head waiter went to greet the rockstar, now joined by her companions.
              Probably fellow band members, he thought, also noting the presence of her raven-haired rockstar sister.
            </p>
            <p>Completing a couple more tasks in the wait station, the young server then reluctantly returned to the
              table, now a scene of fashionable camaraderie, and awkwardly placed goblets of ice water and baskets of
              bread among the chattering group.</p>
            <p>Unable to disregard the great chasm suddenly thrust between himself and the lovely woman whose prolonged
              gaze, only moments before, filled him with such delirium, he now endeavored to avoid eye contact. And
              likely aware that he must now know of her superstar ranking, she probably did as well. </p>

              <p id="ab">
                Not long after the above encounter, I was waiting tables at another Kirkland
                restaurant when Nancy's sister Anne, and a woman who appeared to be her mom, entered and sat in my
                section.
                Anne was very polite and pleasant. The only thing regarding the famous singer which stood out to me was
                how she ordered her steak. Which was blue.

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head</h4>
            <p>Almost immediately upon his hiring at the upscale barbecue place, Chef Ned and I became friends. I had
              little cooking experience at the time, and by contrast, he was a veteran who previously worked
              side-by-side with two of the nation's rising star culinarians, Norman Van Aken and the late Charlie
              Trotter.</p>
            <p>The chef who hired Ned was a genuine talent and friend as well, but due to youth, intemperate drinking
              and a volatile temper, was ill-positioned for the job. This becoming increasingly apparent to the
              establishment's owner it was only a short time hence when he let the young kitchen head go, replacing him
              with the far more competent, and (thankfully) far easier-going Chef Ned. </p>
            <p>I learned a great deal from Ned, and with the aid of his extensive teaching - spanning four years and an
              equal number of restaurants - became a solid line cook. And for his mentoring and sharing of his
              considerable talent and experience I will always be grateful.</p>

              <p>
                When making Crab or seafood cakes, rather than breadcrumbs, try using rice as a binder. It works,
                and tastes, <em>much</em> better. In a food processor just blend some cold basmati or jasmine rice and
                work in enough to the fish/seafood mixture to bind.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                Pure&egrave;d shrimp (or shrimp and rice) works good also.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                Make sure that whatever seafood for the cakes is used is very well dried.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                If you want the cakes to taste like seafood, avoid strong additions like peppers or zucchini. I've found
                A little saute&egrave;d onion or fennel along
                with lemon and tarragon is enough.

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head 2</h4>
            <p>An avid hiker during that period of my life, I would frequently recount my alpine experiences to the new
              chef while at work, and at some point he expressed an interest to join me on a future trek. Shortly after
              Ned and I planned a hike to lake Serene, a mountain-top jewel in the Northern Cascades, near Gold Bar
              Washington.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the lake's trailhead we began our ascent and soon came upon a group of two couples sitting on
              a large rock slab overlooking a creek, a little off the left side of the path. Engaging our attention one
              of the group, a thirty-something guy, asked if we were were interested in buying a beer. Grinning he
              pulled a 40 ounce bottle of Old English 800 from a cooler. "Nice and cold," He said. We declined. The
              offer was a first in my hiking experience, but no further drama ensued with the beer guy nor his
              companions, and we got on with our hike.<p></p>
              <p>Upon our return, however, when only about half a mile from the trailhead, gunshots suddenly began to
                report quite close to the vicinity of our descent.</p>
              <p>Attempting to alert the unseen shooter of our presence we repeatedly hollered down towards the gunshot
                sounds. But much to our increasing agitation the shooting commenced, off and on, until we arrived at the
                previously noted rock slab area. It was still occupied by the two couples but now the beer guy - clearly
                having partaken of more than a little of his malt - was brandishing a pistol about and, once again,
                blasting shots into a rocky area up the mountain side. And all in the group seemed to be taking boozy
                delight in his recklessness.</p>
              <p>Nearing the shooter I pleaded for a pause in the firing before hustling past him as quickly as
                possible. Only to then be stunned by a question from Ned, who lagged slightly behind:</p>
              <p>"Hey, you still got that beer?"</p>
              <p>Reloading his gun the beer guy grinned. "Sure do."<br />"Can I buy one?"<br />"Don't see why not. Come
                on
                over here."<br />

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head 3</h4>

            Amazed I watched as Ned strode closer to the armed, drunk, power-deranged beer
            guy.<br />"How much you want for it?"<br />"How much you willing to pay?"<br />Perhaps noting the beer
            guy's lurking malevolence, Ned seemed to suddenly grasp the danger.<br />"Oh, well," he said, his voice
            thinner, higher-pitched, "um...whatever you think is fair."<br />"Well gimme twenty bucks then," said the
            beer guy, and his friends laughed. Ned laughed too, nervously.<br />"Ha Ha. That's alright. Guess I'll get
            going now." And he turned to leave.<br />"You sure as hell wont!" Said the other, and fired up the
            mountain. "We still got some business to take care of."<br />Forced to stop and re-engage the beer guy,
            who now threateningly waved his pistol, Ned responded. "I...I don't have 20 dollars."<br />"Then make a
            counter offer, dipshit. <em>Negotiate."</em><br />"I...I only have four dollars, is that..."<br />"Four
            dollars! Are you trying to insult me, buddy?"<br />"No, man. That's really all I have." And he pulled out
            his wallet and removed the four dollar bills.<br />Momentarily glaring at Ned, the beer guy then looked to
            his friends."Should I let this dipshit rip me off?" They laughed. "That's up to you," a women
            said.<br />"Ok dipshit, lucky for you I'm in a good mood. Get over here and let's finish this
            deal."<br />It was only a few steps, but Ned walked slow, his legs wobbling. He handed over the
            money.<br /> Again glaring, the beer guy reached into the cooler, pulled out a forty, moved it towards
            Ned. Then grinned. "Here you go, dipshit."<br />Hand shaking, Ned took the bottle and turned.<br />"Ha!
            Ha! Ha!" The beer guy screamed, and positioning his pistol right behind Ned's head, fired several shots
            upward. "Ha! Ha! Ha!"
            </p>
            <p>I'll never forget the look on a man's face who believes he's suddenly going to die.</p>

            <h4>The Brothers Dumas</h4>
            <p>Charm has many forms, many facets, many faces. Though different in essence Alexander and Frederick Dumas
              were both enormously charm-gifted. Raised in the south Seattle hood, neither Alex nor Fred were inclined
              towards the rap-culture thuggery common to the area; preferring, rather, to interact with two distinct but
              equally effective versions of humor, and charm.</p>
            <p>The barbecue joint was located on a busy corner of Capitol Hill, Seattle, where Alex and Fred worked.
              Alex was a prep cook, Fred a dishwasher. After a few years working front house gigs, I was back in the
              kitchen, painting ribs and grilling steaks at the same place. Walnut-hued, medium height and fit, Alex was
              baritone-chatty, friendly, open, innocent. Fred was a shade darker, taller, leaner, and with a deeper
              voice that, though less active than his brother's had a tone of cleverness and irony. With only a slight
              alteration in demeanor or expression either could have looked intimidating, even menacing. But neither
              seemed suited towards, or interested in, being thus - their appearances invariably projecting geniality
              and humor.</p>
            <p>The restaurant's street level cooking line was behind the bar with an open view of the dining room and
              the busy Uptown streets beyond. During lunch and dinner service, myself and the other line cooks
              communicated by phone with the prep cooks and dishwashers, who worked in a spacious preparation area, one
              floor below. In need of a red onion during a busy lunch one day I phoned downstairs and Alex answered.</p>
            <p>"Dumas Diner, chef speaking," He joked.<br />
              "Hey Alex, can you bring up a red onion."<br />
              "Okay!"<br />
              "Need it quick, please."<br />
              "Alright!"</p>
            <p>It seemed too long a delay (when one is busy it always does, right?) but Alex finally did arrive. He gave
              me the onion. It was yellow. </p>
            <p>"Didn't I ask for a red onion?"<br />
              "Yeah, but those other ones are purple...."</p>
            <p>Funny. And <em>charming.</em></p>
          </div>
          <div class="col dumas2">
            <p id="center">13</p>
            <h4>The Brothers Dumas 2</h4>
            <p>If to insult seems to be the intention of the above anecdote then I have been misconstrued. Alex was a
              wonderful, genuinely amusing person. But as with us all there were times - largely due to his charming
              innocence - that his humor was not entirely intentional. And lest you think the brothers' names are
              falsified to mock, or - in the case of the last name "Dumas" - intended as a demeaning pun, you would be
              wrong on both points. Their names as here written, both first and last, are genuine.</p>
            <p>Other instances of Alex's charm, both witting and not, I could include in this brief portrait, but prefer
              to move on to one involving his brother Fred, who was equally ready and able to amuse.</p>
            <p>One night before a Holiday dinner event my good friend chef Ned, (First-class <em>and</em> first-rate)
              and I were on the upstairs line preparing a few turkeys. Needing some bread to make stuffing, I called the
              prep kitchen and in his deep bass voice, Fred answered:</p>
            <p>"Boiler room!"<br />"Hey Fred, can you bring up a couple loaves of bread?"<br /> "Sure. Need 'em
              tonight?"<br />"That's probably best, Fred."<br />"Ok, get my peeps right on it."</p>
            <p>A loaf in each hand, Fred lumbered up to the line and dropped them on the counter. Then pointing to a bag
              of giblets next to one of the turkeys, asked:</p>
            <p>"That its balls?"<br /> "Sure is Fred," answered the chef.<br /> "Why they in the bag?"<br /> "In case
              anyone wants to eat 'em, I guess."<br />"Hmm. So where's its penis?"</p>
            <p>Skipping nary a beat chef Ned reached into the turkey and pulled out the neck.<br />Following a few
              seconds silence Fred shook his head and smiled.</p>
            <p>"Damn."</p>

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 1</h4>
            <p>It was un upscale brewery restaurant in downtown Seattle at which the celebrity chef was recently hired.
              That he refused to even taste the fine beer struck me as odd, but of little consequence. Of greater
              consequence was the veiled dislike he had for me from the very start of his employment; and which only a
              short time hence developed into undisguised hatred.</p>
            <p>I had been working at the place since before it opened, finishing the wooden dining tables, organizing
              the kitchen equipment, cleaning, etc. It was a beautiful place with wood-and-copper-fronted beer tanks
              inside a spacious, open dining area; and a gorgeous solid-copper, half-circle-shaped bar. The owner was
              British as were the lesser-carbonated, lightly-chilled ales. Once open I worked the grill and saut&egrave;
              stations at night, a key position. And I was very good at my job.</p>
            <p>My afore-mentioned friend, Ned, was the original chef, but upon securing a position with
              former colleague and rising-star-chef Norman Van Aken at a new Florida restaurant, he gave his notice and
              left. A solid replacement, chef Tom, was then hired, did an admirable job, and became on friendly terms
              with me as well. But after just a few months he gave his notice and began the interviewing process for
              another kitchen head.</p>
            <p>At some point during his interviews chef Tom told me that one interested applicant was something of Los
              Angeles celebrity, having been sous (assistant) chef to Wolfgang Puck at one of his (Puck's) successful
              ventures. I was intrigued and voiced my not insignificant support to hire him.</p>
            <p>Soon after chosen to be the restaurant's 3rd chef, the L.A. celebrity came on to the line to meet me. He
              was a gruff, somewhat neanderthal-esque looking dude and after a brief introduction in a growly voice
              asked:
            </p>
            <p>"So, does it get pretty hot in here?"</p>
            <p>The kitchen being open and adjacent to the temperature controlled dining area - hence clearly not a
              particularly hot cooking environment - the question seemed odd. I told him no, the kitchen wasn't
              particularly hot.</p>
            <p>"Does it get pretty stressful?"</p>
            <p>"Sometimes, but not more than any other line cooking job," I answered, again thinking the question odd,
              as though he was fishing for a certain response. During that first encounter I noticed as well that
              though he was smiling and acting friendly, something about his manner betrayed annoyance. And his eyes
              were hostile.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col celebChef2">
            <p id="center">16</p>
            <h4>Celebrity Chef 2</h4>
            <p>Shortly after the L.A. chef was hired, another California guy was brought on to replace the General
              Manager. An openly gay San Franciscan, the new GM didn't seem to take a shine to me either.</p>
            <p>I imagine it is not unusual for new management to have some resentment for well-entrenched staff, as I
              was; and especially those with a strong and positive relationship with the owner - as I had. But whereas
              the new GM's mild annoyance seemed typical new boss/subordinate stuff, the chef's ever-mounting contempt,
              and attendant rudeness, badgering and temper flare-ups - towards me alone - were becoming increasingly
              <em>atypical</em> and concerning.</p>
            <p>One night, however, he came onto the kitchen line with a smile again a obscuring the wrath of his eyes,
              and began a conversation thus:</p>
            <p>"<em>Je pence donc je sui."</em></p>
            <p>Never having given him any indication that I spoke French, it was yet again another of the chef's
              conversational oddities. But at least the smile was back, so I played along and asked what he meant.

              and classical music. Letting him know I was a reader and classical music enthusiast as well, a temporary

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 3</h4>
            <p>I was living a few blocks up from the busy, central part of Capitol Hill. It was a quiet part of the
              hill, but there were some nice shops and restaurants within a couple of blocks; and the general area had a
              pleasing balance of greenery and interesting homes and buildings. I really liked living there, and told
              him. At the time Capitol Hill also had - likely still does - a notably large gay community, and I informed
              him of this as well. And of course there was the bustling central area replete of clubs, bars and eateries
              of all types, a stylish and unique shopping mall, and a couple of wonderful old-school movie theaters.
              Capitol Hill was an eclectic and exciting place for a youth such as myself. I really did like living
              there.</p>
            <p>Whether or not my enthusiasm for the place had any impact on the chef's decision, I never did find out.
              But as time passed there were things about <em>him</em> I absolutely did learn. First was that he was of
              that managerial breed which vastly prefers swinging a clipboard, yakking on the phone and basking in the
              schmooze of sales people, over any genuine labor. And that was probably a good thing since those rare
              times when he deigned to enter the cooking line and make a plate of food, it inevitably was an
              embarrassment to all but himself. And when the place was jammed and he was needed on the line he quite
              often fell apart. A good example of this occurred one evening prior to a late Seahawk game, not long
              before my termination. The place was slammed and every line cook was tasked with a multitude of orders
              needing immediate attention. In spite of how busy it was I watched in awe as the celebrity chef struggled
              with a paltry order of two tomato-and-cream-based seafood pastas. After placing the pasta and seafood into
              the pans he was then clearly befuddled over how to proceed. Embittered and ashamed, he reluctantly caught
              my eye and asked what to do.</p>
            <p>"Deglaze with wine and add tomato sauce," I told him, "and finish with cream." He then commenced to
              babble repeatedly "yes, cream, cream!" while adding <em>just cream</em> to the pans before slopping his
              finished work into bowls bound for two unfortunate patrons.</p>
            <p>Likely stinging from his observed incompetence, the chef never again tried to mask his seething
              hostility, and going forward even refused to speak to me. Meanwhile I was hearing from a couple of other
              line cooks how favored they were by the L.A. chef, and how according to him they were destined to become
              his new "dream team."</p>
            <p>I wasn't sure how the new chef was going to sell his decision to fire me to the owner, but the scent was
              in the air; the writing on the wall: I was on my way out.</p>

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 4</h4>
            <p>Soon after, during a day off the owner, Richard, called and informed me that I was fired; that both the
              chef and GM told him it needed to happen; and that as much as it distressed him, he had to respect their
              desire. Instructing me to come in later to pick up my final check, he then said we could discuss further
              details of their reasoning if I wanted.</p>
            <p>I arrived at the restaurant in the evening and joined Richard who was sitting at the bar clasping a full
              pint of blond ale. Upon telling him I did want to hear why I was fired he asked the bartender to bring me
              a pint as well, and in his cultured British-accent, started explaining.</p>
            <p>"The chef insists you're a homophobe, and has convinced the GM of it. He said you told him not to move to
              Capital Hill because of the prominent gay presence there. And said that you said gay people disgust you."
            </p>
            <p>It was incredible. "Um, really?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"But..you don't believe that...do you?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. Considering your friendship with Robin [a gay fellow line cook who indeed was a friend] it
              doesn't really make sense."</p>
            <p>"The chef is lying," I said, fury mounting and making it hard to speak calmly. "He's absolutely lying.
              Has wanted me gone since he was hired. Despises me."</p>
            <p>"I'm afraid I must respect their decision. It's because -"</p>
            <p>"But this is absurd," I cut in. "I told him I <em>like</em> living on Capitol Hill."</p>
            <p>"Did you say anything about the gay presence there?"</p>
            <p>"He asked me what it was like. I told him there was a large gay community. Never said they disgust me.
              I...I can't believe this."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col celebChef5">
            <p id="center">20</p>
            <h4>Celebrity Chef 5</h4>
            <p>"Well the problem is the GM believes him - you know he's gay, right? - and they both consider it grounds
              for your removal. And since I did hire the both of them to manage - to make the important decisions - it
              is necessary for me to show them my confidence. I'm very sorry."</p>
            <p>"But...Richard listen...<b>what that manipulative jackass of an incompetent chef said <em>isn't
                  true</em></b>....I <em>knew</em> there was something wrong with this guy... He's fucking off, Richard.
              Whacked. <em>Bad."</em></p>
            <p>For a while we thus continued but Richard would not relent. My argument was not to prevail. The celebrity
              chef would have his way.</p>
            <p>Finding another job was not an issue. Within a couple of weeks I was working the saut&egrave; station at
              an upscale Italian restaurant near the waterfront. A few months after I got a call from my friend Chef Ed
              Hale, asking if I wanted to work with him at the Van Aken's venture. I did indeed and planned for it. En
              route, however, about thirty miles west of Las Vegas my car caught fire and was destroyed. After three
              days mulling things over in Pahrump Nevada, I decided to take a rental car to beautiful Lake Tahoe, and
              try my luck there.</p>
            <p>I was a year in Tahoe and loved it. And would have remained had I not let a girl who I was then with
              convince me to move back with her to the northwest, so she could finish her studies at Western Washington
              University.</p>
            <p>Back in the Northwest, I eventually made it in to the brewery restaurant. The celebrity chef was gone. I
              asked Richard what had happened, and he said the chef got too burned out to handle things. After another
              year or so, I checked back and the place had changed ownership.</p>
            <p>Several years hence I was working with a guy who had worked with the L.A. celebrity chef as well. He told
              me the reason for him leaving L.A. was due to some scandal he was embroiled in. Curious I later googled
              <b>L.A. celebrity chef,</b> and his name: <b>John Sweeney.</b> And among other tragic reporting, read
              this:</p>

            <h4>And She Called Me A Liar</h4>
            <p>It was a swank restaurant, lounge and tennis club in the heart of Incline Village, Lake Tahoe. I had only
              been in Tahoe a few days, and this was my first job interview. The chef was tall and direct, and in a
              strong, commanding voice asked me if I had cooking experience. "Yes." Then asked if I had <em>French</em>
              cooking experience. "Yes." Then told me I was hired and to start the following day. <em>Gard Manger</em>
              position. My job was line preparation of salads, appetizers and desserts.</p>
            <p>The chef's last name was identical in pronunciation to that of a then famous chef, one Roger
              Verg&eacute;, (Ver-<em>jhay)</em> and during one of my first days working with him, I asked if there was
              any relation. To my surprise he said there was, that Roger Verg&eacute; was his Uncle. Knowing nothing of
              the chef I had no reason to doubt him, but as the cloth-stenciled spelling on his chef's jacket didn't
              match that of my recollection of the French master's last name, I was a bit mystified. Out of curiosity
              the next day I went to the library and located one of Chef Verg&eacute;'s books. The spelling was, as I
              thought, different from that of my current boss. Quite different.</p>
            <p>The Tahoe Chef liked my work, and we soon became friends. He was a fine chef, professionally trained and
              gifted with an excellent palate and nose. He was also self-confident, tremendously charismatic, popular
              with women and very at ease with the local celebrities. </p>
            <p>Before long we were goofing off together outside of work. Checking out new places to have lunch. Sneaking
              into the restaurant after closing hours to snag a bottle of wine, "<em>I've got a key!</em>." Dinner with
              the wives - I was recently married, he for a few years. Playing blackjack at the Hyatt. And when winter
              arrived, skiing at one of the many nearby resorts. We had many good times, I really liked the man. It was
              fun to be with him. Even as it became clear that he really was a bad sort, and a big time liar.</p>

              Renaissance.” – Steven Wright</p>

            <h4>And She Called Me A Liar 2</h4>
            <p>To me it made no sense. He was popular and accomplished. There didn't seem to be any sound reason to
              fabricate his experiences or embellish his rich, active life, but that he did. A great deal.</p>
            <p>Of course he was not nephew to Roger Verg&eacute;. Nor, as plainly evident by his clumsy skiing, had he
              ever been an instructor - though insisting to me he had. Nor was he a "semi pro" golfer as a waiter told
              me the chef had claimed, before playing a round with him and witnessing "the lamest game ever." During
              spirited conversation many of his truth-sworn reminiscences, however funny and forcefully told, were
              obvious lies - at least to those who had come to know him. And in particular obvious to his sweet, adoring
              wife who, regardless of the falsehood's transparency would simply look to him smiling and say: "Oh,
              honey." But never once did I hear the veracity of his tales challenged. He was a king among subjects.</p>
            <p>As plentiful as were the chef's lies was his infidelity. At length becoming both friend and confidant I
              was increasingly made familiar with the details of the chef's cheating, as well as with some of the
              side-girls themselves who often would show up late at the restaurant before leaving with him.</p>
            <p>At some point the chef even rented a small apartment to more easily facilitate encounters with a new babe
              that he seemed especially fond of. Quite in opposition to his sweet, naive wife the current paramour - who
              was now regularly dropping by the restaurant - walked, dressed, laughed and generally behaved like a
              tramp. But there was no question regarding her allure. Clearly enamored, the chef even admitted to me that
              of all his side babes, she was the most exciting, and that he could even imagine divorcing his wife for
              her. A naturally happy, buoyant person, with this new hottie in his life he was positively elated.</p>
            <p>One day, however, he came to the restaurant in a very obvious funk. Quiet, sullen, brooding, I'd never
              seen him thus. After a few hours wondering what could be the cause of his distress, he told me his new
              girlfriend said she couldn't take him anymore, and broke up. Then looking to me with a wounded expression
              of utter sadness and offense, said:</p>

              <p id="amb">
                My two best Tahoe friends were Joe and Matt. One summer night the three of us got loaded on Jaeger shots
                and decided to take a swim. It was breezy and the cold lake alive with choppy waves. Numb with booze and
                undaunted we disrobed and dove in. After bobbing about for a while we swam ashore, only to learn we had
                drifted from where we disrobed. And in the intense dark couldn't find our clothes. After a few minutes
                bumbling around, Matt - a thick, beefy guy - became irritable and climbed up to the roadside. I don't
                recall how long it took to find our clothes. But it was at least long enough for a couple dozen
                motorists to see a buck-naked, pissed off-looking beefy dude with arms crossed, and fat ass planted on a
                rail post.

            <h4>Sa'issfaction</h4>
            <p>Shortly after the chef's girl broke up with him a beautiful, sultry blonde was hired to seat customers.
              Before long she and the chef were leaving together, and he was again of good cheer.</p>
            <p>As previously written, the Chef was a man at ease even with the rich and famous. David Coverdale, lead
              singer of the rock band "White Snake" lived in the area, was a regular customer and buddy to the chef. And
              at the time Mr. Coverdale was recording an album with legendary Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page - also
              now a regular restaurant patron, and chummy with the chef as well.</p>
            <p>At some point during the guitar great's Tahoe sojourn, he consented to play with a local rock band in the
              restaurant's lounge. Though a small venue - 150 person capacity, perhaps - the band erected an impressive
              stack of amplifiers, which, upon hopping up to the bar-sized stage, Mr. Page gave instructions to "crank
              'er up."</p>
            <p>Though it literally pained me to do so, I watched the entire hour-or-so-long performance from the right
              edge of the stage, directly in front of the right side amps, no more than six or seven feet from the rock
              and roll legend, himself. Looking to be in his mid-forties, Mr. Page's physical presence was less than
              impressive. No longer the ripped, axe-slashing super stud in gleaming leather bell bottoms, Page was now
              hunched and scrawny with lots of grey in the yet long rock-n-roll hairdo. And he had a grotesque way of
              contorting his face and thrusting out his aging lips when playing. But his guitar mastery was truly
              impressive. Hence, in spite of his frumpy, oddball demeanor (and the deafening noise level) I was happy to
              have witnessed the show.</p>
            <p>After the performance the rock star sat at a table sipping beer with his girlfriend (or wife), a brawny,
              long-haired bodyguard, and a few idolizing strangers bold enough to hang with a legend. To his immediate
              right also sat the chef. Suffering from hearing loss that would last three or four days, I sat at the bar
              unobtrusively (I hoped) observing.</p>
            <p>With most of the table's attention focused on the chattering guitarist and chef, there suddenly occurred
              a burst of loud, prolonged laughter from the entire group. Partially deaf and a bit far away to comprehend
              the levity, I asked the chef about it when at length he approached the bar for a drink refill. He was
              happy to answer. Evidently a coven of she-satanists knew Page was in town, were furtively dogging his
              activities, and some were even at present in the lounge. Mr. Page, apparently, represented an extremely
              elevated status - near to satan himself - in their dark belief's hierarchy. The chef then said that upon
              being informed of this the rock legend grinned and in his high-pitched heavily Brit-accented voice
              (admirably mimicked by the chef) quipped:</p>
            <p>"Don't really mind who they think I am, really. Long as they gimme sa'issfaction in the bathroom."</p>
            <p>As curious as any rock fan of the comings and goings of a true legend, I yet declined to wait for
              confirmation.</p>

            <p id="center">26</p>
            <h4>Let's Give Him A Hand!</h4>
            <p>Though his wife was now with child, the chef's relationship with the blonde hostess continued, increasing
              in its seriousness. Always a bit heavy, he was now working out, toning up, slimming down and visiting
              tanning booths as well - physical changes that became increasingly noticible and were likely at the new
              gal's insistence.</p>
            <p>Also changing were his dinner specials. Previously creating pretty much exclusively French, or Italian
              (at times) cuisines, he was more and more working with traditionally Asian foods and flavors. Curries,
              tandouri, peanut sauces, sticky rice and rice noodles, spicy chilies, sesame oil, etc. were being
              substituted for, or combined with the restaurant's usual Mediterranean fare.</p>
            <p>One day I asked why the changes, and he told me:</p>
            <p>"We're going to Santa Fe. Opening up an Asian-Fusion place. Calling it "The Edge." <br />"Really? You
              mean you and the new hottie?" I asked.<br />"Hey! Don't talk about her like that. She can read too, you
              know."<br />"I'm sure she can," I said, surprised by the intensity of his umbrage."And didn't mean to
              imply she couldn't."<br />"Well anyway, yeah, that's what's going on. You wanna come with us?"</p>
            <p>Having already committed to move back to the Northwest, I told him no, I couldn't. And decided it was
              probably best not to ask about his wife and unborn kid.</p>
            <p>Not long after the entire staff was compelled to attend a meeting to be conducted by the financing owner.
              A guy as dopey as he was rich - and he was quite rich - it would no doubt prove to be little more than
              time wasted.</p>
            <p>The meeting time came and my suspicions were confirmed. Phrases like "effectuating positive," "zeroing in
              on the excellence," and "fluid client responsiveness" tumbled forth, sedating all but the usual
              grandstanding sycophants into a groggy stupor.</p>
            <p>Winding it up, his last order of business was to heartily thank the chef for his excellent
              work.<br />"You've done a great job chef....Let's give him a hand!" he concluded, and all obeyed.</p>
            <p>Beaming, the chef raised his fists and pumped them above his head in victory. </p>
            <p>The following day the chef did not show up for work, nor would there ever again. Word then spread that
              during the previous night someone with a key entered and robbed the place blind.</p>

            <h4>Take My Wife - <em>Please</em> 1</h4>
            <p>It wasn't depression, but for quite some time after moving from Beautiful Lake Tahoe to Bellingham,
              Washington, I was not very happy.</p>
            <p>It was late fall when my ex wife and I arrived. The town was damp and dreary, grey all the time. Worse, a
              hazy chemical stench from the Georgia Pacific paper processing mill eternally mingled with the saline air.
            </p>
            <p>We were both hired on at The Oyster Bar on Chuckanut Drive, a nice hillside place with a view of the
              Northern Puget Sound and San Juan Islands. She to wait tables, I to work in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>The chef was a good, hardworking mild-mannered guy. I liked him from the start. But there were a couple
              of cooks I did not like, nor did they like me. One an army vet who spoke in a serpentine whisper, and
              mumbled a lot. The other a thick, conniving, Canadian loud mouth. The two were pals - a mother and a
              father snake - snotty with the chef, and constantly screwing off.</p>
            <p>As much as I liked the ex, and still do, we never should have married. She was - surely still is - a
              bubbly, outgoing, <em>very</em> loquacious type. More or less my opposite. And after the new-love varnish
              rubbed off, we spent more time bickering than any thing else. At times being a moody, sarcastic sort I
              can't say I wasn't part to blame. But I swear I never came across anyone with such tenacity to argue.
              Likely never will.</p>
            <p>But the bickering was generally when she and I were by ourselves. Working together at the restaurant we
              most often got along. The same can't be said regarding my ex and the army vet and his Canadian pal.
              Especially concerning the vet. In that whispery voice of his he was just as eager to quibble and
              contradict as she. At work they were always squabbling. And the restaurant was small. No place to go to
              get out of earshot of their constant back-and-forth. Just plain annoying.</p>
            <p>At some point the Canadian got promoted to the chef position at a new place started by the same owner and
              shortly after got canned when the owner figured out what a dufus he was.</p>

            <div class="AB">
              <h5>
                Amuse Bouche
              </h5>
              <p id="amb">The Oyster Bar kitchen has an east-facing window with a view of the small, roadside parking
                area. One afternoon just shortly before opening a very nice Mercades pulled in and a well dressed man
                and woman exited. Knowing the front entrance was still locked I went out and asked the couple if their
                intention was to dine. "What do you think, genius," the gentleman spat, tugging the locked door. "Now
                could you just arrange to have us let in...?" I
                wont detail what shortly followed. But will strongly advise against copping a snotty, superior attitude
                - though
                superior you may be - to the guy about to make your food.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Take My Wife - <em>Please</em> 2</h4>
            <p>Kind of a funny story about what
              finally happened to make the owner give the guy the boot. Apparently the Canadian guy refused to cook a
              steak well-done for a customer. Said it was against his culinary principles. As luck would have it, the
              customer was the owner's mom. Shazam! No more uppity Canadian chef.</p>
            <p>But at work I still had to deal with the constant quibbling of my ex and the vet. Went on non stop for a
              few solid months. Bugged the crap outta me. At the time didn't know exactly why, but around late
              spring/early-summer their bickering began to subside. Things got a lot more civil. Probably as a
              consequence both me and my ex actually started getting along with the vet, sometimes even doing things
              with him.</p>
            <p>Between me and her, though, things just got worse - the arguments getting longer, hotter, weirder. One
              night at an outdoor party my ex seemed to have even more than her usual belly full of sassafras, and we
              got into something that kept going round and round. When I was finally able to break free I walked over to
              the vet who was grilling salmon on the barbecue. "Take my wife," I said to him. "<em>Please."</em></p>
            <p>And by golly he did! Not sure the of the exact chronology of things but as summer rolled along I kept
              noticing how their mannerisms toward each other got warmer, more intimate-looking. Then at a party at the
              beach one night they sat side-by-side in front of the fire all night long, just talking, relating.</p>
            <p>Then one day I get phone message where the guy says: "Hey boy...you better watch your
              back...<em>boy,"</em> then hangs up. He was trying to disguise his voice but there was no mistaking that
              whispery, snake-like intonation. It was surely the vet. I guessed that he and the ex must a been a bona
              fide item, and that he was just pissing around his new territory.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the ex wasn't owning up to anything. And in spite of the menacing phone message, when working
              or doing any sort of socializing with the vet, he was always pretty friendly.</p>
            <p>Then things got resolved in a nice, easy way when one evening I saw my ex yakking it up on a pay phone.
              It was mid summer, around 7 so there was still plenty of daylight. No mistaking it was the ex. So she
              comes home later, maybe 11 or so, and I ask where she's been. She tells me at work, which I know is a lie
              because wait shifts at the Oyster Bar start between 4 and 5. Then I tell her that's strange because I saw
              her jabbering on a pay phone around 7.</p>
            <p>Well her eyes then pretty much confessed, and not long after her mouth. Yeah, she was with the vet. They
              were indeed an item. Went on to have a couple of kids and last I saw of them - when they dropped into a
              restaurant I subsequently owned - they seemed a happy family. Though I have to admit I was a little
              curious about that shiner she was wearing.</p>

          <div class="col bj1">
            <p id="center">30</p>
            <h4>Bennie and Joan</h4>
            <p>One night while line cooking at The Oyster Bar the owner came up to me carrying a plate that had a piece
              of plastic in with the vegetables. It was a new guy doing the vegetables that put them there, but since I
              was the lead cook, no question I was partly to blame. "How'd this get in here," the owner barked. Well I
              didn't really know and was too busy to come up with a clever answer, so I just told him it was an
              oversight, that sometimes shit happen. Not happy with my response he then got in my face.</p>
            <p>"That's a real jackass answer," he said, visibly irate."I gotta have something more than <em>that</em> to
              tell the customer. Now how'd it get in here!"</p>
            <p>It wasn't the first time he blew up at me, or someone else in the kitchen, just trying to a good job on a
              busy night so I got probably more irate than he was and walked out. A couple weeks later I was hired to
              cook at another restaurant on the puget sound, but this one more of a diner-by-the-sea place that every
              waterfront area seems to have. And like all those other crappy places, there was a cranky, domineering
              waitress lifer.</p>
            <p>Her name was Joan, but she looked, sounded and acted more like a middle-aged Betty Davis. The
              establishment's uncontested acting lieutenant, Joan - a former Georgian - was pale and gaunt with bleached
              yellow hair and a raspy, wheezy chain-smoking voice. And though brusque and sometimes crotchety Joan was
              also capable of playful banter and took customer service very seriously. Consequently she was well like by
              most of the restaurant's patrons, and was an old friend to lots of the regulars. Concerning her staff
              subordinates - and that was pretty much everyone except the chef and GM - she could, however, be a
              brutally derisive enemy. Competent at my job and coming from an exaulted establishment like The Oyster
              Bar, I was never subjected to Joan's derision or wrath - a sure sign of her approval and respect. Not so
              regarding Bennie.</p>
            <p>Bennie was hired on as a busboy shortly after I began. Acne-faced, bespectacled, plain and pudgy, he was
              a nice kid but somewhat timid and clearly new to the restaurant business. And poor Bennie, or "Bennuh" as
              she called him, was vehemently neither approved of nor respected by Joan.</p>
            <p>"Bennuh!...<em>Bennuh!</em> " became a commonplace refrain upon Joan entering the kitchen - soon followed
              by the inevitable berating:</p>
            <p>"Bennuh how come those ashtrays on table four are full of butts Bennuh? Let me see them glasses of yours
              Bennuh, 'cause if they ain't completely fogged up then you must be able to see, and if you can see maybe
              you're just too dumb to know what a full ashtray looks like."</p>
            <p>"Bennuh! <em>Bennuh!</em> Mr. Anderson on table eight says he asked you for coffee <em>more'n five
                minutes ago.</em> It's lunchtime, Bennuh, not your lazy-ass breaktime. Now get that coffee out there!"
            </p>

            <p>"Bennuh! <em>Bennuh!</em> I got people waitin' and table twelve's still dirty. I thought you were hired
              to bus tables, Bennuh. Or maybe you think bussing tables is my job, Bennuh. Is that what you think,
              <em>Bennuh?</em> That I'm here to do <em>your</em> job, Bennuh?"</p>
            <p>Now it's true Bennie wasn't a busboy rockstar, but his incompetence, at least from my perspective, really
              didn't merit the level of Joan's venom. She was just the type that would not hold her peace regarding one
              she didn't like. And she didn't like Bennie. And Bennie being the shy, non-confrontational type that he
              was, only got flustered by the continuous berating, and never said a word of contradiction, nor in his own
              defense.</p>
            <p>Then came a day when a lapse in Bennie's responsibilities was deemed so egregious by Joan that, rather
              than wait until he retreated to the kitchen she verbally pummelled him in front of a a full dining room.
              It not being an open kitchen I wasn't able to see the drama, but since it occurred on table 1 - the
              closest to the kitchen - I heard in it's glorious entirety:</p>
            <p>"Get over here Bennuh right now and look at this table! Two water glasses almost empty, an ashtray full
              of butts, and empty plates that have been sittin' here for God knows how long! When are you gonna start
              earning your money Bennuh. When are you gonna start doin' your job! Now take these plates away and change
              that filthy ashtray. And fill up that water pitcher and get back here and fill those glasses, you
              worthless slacker. I tell you now I'm just plain sick of lookin' after you like you was a damn retard. Now
              go you!"</p>
            <p>Entering the kitchen Bennie's face was as red as if he'd been given a physical pummeling as well, and he
              was breathing hard and irregular. Then with a seeming planned purpose he went into the walk in cooler and
              came out carrying a can of whipped cream. Then he grabbed a styrofoam to-go plate from the counter and
              just as Joan was coming through the swinging kitchen doors squirts a big fluffy
              mound of the cream on it.</p>
            <p>"Bennuh!" <em>"Bennuh!!!" </em></p>
            <p> Then Bennie throws a perfect bullseye.</p>

            <h4>My Car smells Like Shit</h4>
            <p>
              Where and when is not relevent. But this really did happen. One night during dinner service A waiter,
              Barrie, came up to me and said to check out something going on at one of his tables.
              I peeked into the dining room and at the table in question were three men and one woman. The men
              were engaged in a what appeared to be typical restaurant chit chat. The woman was out cold, her head and
              upper body sprawled upon the table. I watched in awe as the men carried on as though nothing was
              amiss.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few minutes later I was back in the kitchen grabbing a quick dinner when suddenly assailed by a horrible
              smell. I looked up and saw Barrie walking astride another waiter, Joey, each with one hand propping up a
              side of the previously passed out woman, who staggered between. With the other hand the waiters jointly
              held a hotel pan beneath the woman's sagging face as she profusely vomited. Of the terrible profusion that
              expelled from the woman's other end little could be done. Other than assist the suffering woman to the
              restroom which, bizarrely, the two waiters were tasked into doing. Covering my nose and mouth with a bar
              towel, I looked back into the dining room. The three men were still carrying on as though all was well.
            </p>
            <p>
              After stablizing and having cleaned up some, the woman was then escorted out of the restaurant by Joey,
              who, for whatever bizarre reason, was tasked with driving her home as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barrie was told, and hence informed me, that the woman had a bad reaction to a couple of hastliy
              consumed martinis. And that what had occurred wasn't, for her, particularly unusual. He also
              told me that one of the men at the table was her husband.
            </p>
            <p>
              A short while later Joey returned. Though apparently a promise was made by the husband to have his car
              detailed, he was yet looking none too pleased.
            </p>
            <p>"My car smells like shit."</p>

                Yes, shit happens. Even in the best restaurants. One busy night at a fine-dining place I received an
                order for herb-breaded scallops only to discover that
                some prep clown blended far too many herbs into the bread. Without time to fix
                it, I reluctantly sent the dish out with an unappealing blueish green mixture atop the
                seafood. No complaint was made, however, and upon checking the returned plate I noticed all
                had been eaten. Clearly even though it looked weird, the dish tasted good. Two or three more orders were
                also sent out and evidentally happily consumed. After the dinner rush, I grabbed the mixture with the
                intention of adding more bread. Then noticed that the nasty color was not from excessive
                herbs, but rather a frightening quantity of mold.

            <h4>Purple Reign</h4>
            <p>
              It's not unusual, and even perhaps fitting, for a good chef to have a big ego. And then there are the
              big-headed mediocrities, with inflated egos that suit them like the threadbare jackets and floppy shoes of
              a clown.
              Purple chef was a fine example of the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before ascending to the Italian restaurant's position of executive chef, purple chef was the evening
              sous and liked to style his dark hair with a whimsical infusion of purple. After the head chef moved on,
              purple chef was granted the popular Bellingham restaurant's top spot. Shortly thereafter hooking up
              with the general manager, the purple reign thus commenced. Their considerable recources combined, purple
              chef was then able to secure a car loan and in soon hence was in possession of a snappy new purple sedan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purple chef liked to park his new purple car just outside the restaurant's back entrance, then stride
              through the kitchen while repeating "I'm having a vision...I'm having a vision...." This in regards to his
              profound and mystic culinary divinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              One time during a staff meeting, purple chef earnestly related that his ambition for the business was to
              create the finest eating establishment between Vancouver Canada and San Francisco. Not long after, purple
              chef and his girlfriend GM, taped paper fishes to the establishment's front window. From then on it was
              the northwest's premier Italian <em>and seafood</em> restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
              In due course, purple chef and GM were married. Afterwards there was a party at the restaurant at which
              all staff were invited and asked to pitch in whatever he or she could to help pay for the new couple's
              honeymoon. Purple chef and bride likely had a combined annual income of $100.000, give or take. The wait
              staff faired moderately well with their tips. Non management kitchen staff each made around $7 per hour.
            </p>
            <p>At some point purple chef and GM wife made a TV commercial. Though his GM wife and a few other employees
              were in the commercial, purple chef was the undisputed star. Chef hat and jacket be-garbed, purple chef
              appeared in several brief scenes elegantly holding a goblet of red wine while
              reciting poetic phrases like "it's about a romance... it's about a symphony of flavors...it's about life
              to be
              savored...." After business hours purple chef, his GM wife and other staff would sometimes
              watch the ad over and over.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col reign2">
            <p id="center">34</p>
            <h4>Purple Reign 2</h4>
            <p>
              Because purple chef was the executive chef, and his wife was GM, and his
              wife dominated her subordinates, and he dominated his wife, purple chef quite naturally also dominated her
              subordinates, in addition to his subordinates. And so held a veritable purple reign on the business. And
              his ego grew.
            </p>
            <p>
              One night while purple chef relaxed with his GM wife in the restaurant's bar, the restaurant suddenly
              filled with people. And with only myself and one other cook, the kitchen labors became overwhelming.
              Fortunately purple chef was summond to help, and after a couple hours of intense food preparation, the
              three of us were through the rush. As purple chef prepared to return to the lounge, the other cook joked
              that he was free to leave, and that we had things under control.</p>
            <p>
              "<b>I saved your butts!</b>" snapped purple chef.
            </p>
            <p>Odd considering it was purple chef's name on the menu. But whatever.</p>
            <p>
              One night purple chef, his GM wife and a few other staff (myself included) went to a large wine tasting
              event at a local hotel. Hundreds and hundreds of wines were open, with accompanying
              stemware, available to all intendees. After a time purple chef rose and addressed his GM wife.
              "I need to take a leak," he said. <b><em>"Watch my wine!</em></b>"
            </p>
            <p>Among his many notable culinary inspirations, "asian guacamole" was a personal favorite of purple chef.
              It was truly a
              clever condiment in which a dash of chopped ginger was added to traditional guacamole. Paired with
              sliced raw tuna, it was offered on the menu as an appetizer. As is customary with raw fish, to keep the
              tuna fresh as possible, it was
              stored in the freezer and thinly sliced to order.</p>
            <p>One evening during dinner service, purple chef was unable to locate a portion of raw pork
              tenderloin that he had previously placed in the freezer. And was quite distressed to learn that during
              lunch it was thought to be tuna and served, raw, with asian guacamole.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when distressed purple chef would sprint upstairs to the private dining room and punch a wall.

            <p>New Year's Eve was consistently one of the restaurant's busiest nights, with all available seating

              exception of the owner's party and the restaurant's staff, the place was empty. It was a curious occurance

            <p>Not too long hence, after having been up for sale for a lengthy period of time, the restaurant sold. I
              had since
              acquired a different job, but heard from a credible source that though purple chef lobbied the new
              proprietors (A husband and wife) to continue on as executive chef, his efforts failed. And the purple
              reign was no more.</p>

                  To extend the life of good bread, put in the fridge when it begins to go stale. Anytime after when you
                  want nice, fresh-tasting bread, slice off a piece, spread with butter or brush with olive oil,and
                  press in an electric grill, such as a panini maker or George Foreman machine. Press a short time for
                  warm, soft bread. Press longer for bread that's flatter and crunchier. As long as it's not pressed
                  overly long, it'll be delish.

            <h4><em>Le Cordon Bleu</em></h4>
            <p>After having spent thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands - on a restaurant it is generally considered
              unwise to blow a hard opening.</p>
            <p>At the aforementioned English Brewery restaurant, during the initial week's hard opening it was decided -
              with questionable wisdom - to advertise and then offer a free lunch. The place filled to capacity and
              remained thus even after the under-prepared kitchen descended into chaos and ran out of food. Most patrons
              that day had a bad experience, would likely not return, and dissuade many to even give the place a chance.
              Being the night saut&egrave; cook I missed the excitement, but naturally heard enough of it to tell of the
              event. I can't say with certainty if this opening blunder had a lasting impact on the business but do know
              that, though the place had periods of high volume, in general it was on the slow side. And was, as
              previously noted, sold after only a few years in operation.</p>
            <p>
              Jumping a few years ahead, I was part of the opening of an upscale wood-fire pizza/Italian restaurant upon
              terminating my employment under the purple reign.
            </p>
            <p>Having more experience than the majority of the other kitchen hirees, my job was to run the more
              complicated appetizer/salad/pasta/ station rather than make pizzas. My partner in this position, though
              with a slightly elevated stature due to his background, was an Italian fellow, "Alberto", whose resume
              included <i>Le Cordon Bleu.</i> Though not yet official, it appeared likely that due to his background and
              his culinary self-confidence, Alberto would - sometime shortly after opening - become the restaurant's
              chef.</p>
            <p>But as opening day approached I began to notice some extremely dubious culinary techniques employed by
              Alberto. Which, on the very morning of the hard opening culminated in the bizarre method of pasta
              preparation by fully cooking it and then storing it for later use <em>in water</em>.</p>
            <Both>Unable to persuade Alberto to do otherwise, I then confronted the two owners and vehemently objected
              to this ridiculous manner of food (and eventaully <em>customer</em>) abuse. But to my astonishment, based
              solely on his self-professed and most likely unverified turn at <em>Le Cordon Bleu,</em> they were both
              convinced that Alberto's ludicrous pasta handling was the best to be done. Both owners had some prior
              restaurant experience, so to owner 1, I asked:</p>
              <p>"Have you ever stored pasta in water?"</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col cordBlu2">
            <p id="center">37</p>
            <h4><em>Le Cordon Bleu 2</em></h4>
            <p>"Well no, but <em>I</em> didn't go to <em>Le Cordon Bleu...."</em> My frustration increasing I asked
              owner 2:</p>
            <p>"Have you ever worked someplace at which the chef, or anyone for that matter, stored the pasta in water?"
            </p>
            <p>"Well no, but I've never worked with a chef, or anyone, who's been through<em> Le Cordon Bleu...."</em>
              Then to both:</p>
            <p>"Have you ever heard of, or seen in a cook book this type of pasta handling?"</p>
            <p>Neither had. But then, neither had engaged in discussions over <em>Le Cordon Bleu</em> pasta handling
              techniques, nor had thumbed through a <em>Le Cordon Bleu</em> cook book.</p>
            <p>My exasperation complete, and indeed sensing a very flawed hard opening, I had a thought. Grabbing a
              handful of the water-marinated pasta, I commenced to throw it into a saut&egrave; pan. To this I added a
              ladleful
              of puttanesca sauce, brought to a simmer, and placed into a pasta bowl. Then requested one of the owners
              to sample.</p>
            <p>
              "Hmmm," said owner 1 upon sampling. "The pasta's mushy, and the sauce way too watery."
              [<em>Very good.</em>] "Better do it your way."
            </p>
            <p>I was then hastily given the nod to manage the station. Opening was a big success and soon after Alberto
              quietly moved on. I recently looked up the Bellingham wood-fire pizza/Italian restaurant on line. After 20
              years it's still there and seems to be doing well.</p>

                It's possible that the only association Alberto really had with <em>Le Cordon Bleu </em> was
                imaginary. The truth I never cared to discover. If his association was genuine, I still would not
                be surprised by his lack of real skills. After Alberto left, a culinary graduate from a local school was
                hired to replace him.
                How he graduated was sheer mystery. He had no talent. Curiously enough, he liked to share stories
                of his education at which his teachers would proclaim one or another of his food creations "the worst
                ever." I could relate. How it goes in other fields, I wouldn't know. But with regards to formal
                education in the culinary world a degree, even from <em>Le Cordon Bleu,</em> often ain't worth jack.

              "Dick" was from a wealthy California family. He thought it would be a good investment to buy several
              vacant
              buildings in what was still called, but didn't really function as, downtown Bellingham. Apparently it was
              his plan to try and restore the largely defunct part of the city to its former prominence. Among the
              properties he purchased was a three storey,beige-brick and concrete Elks building.
            </p>

            <p>Dick was a talker. One evening he asked to join my ex wife and I as we were finishing dinner at a local
              restaurant. And we talked. Or mostly he did. In a rather brainstorming, stream of consciousness

              still employed at the wood-fire place, and ready for a change. And Dick was interested in an upscale
              restaurant to occupy the main floor
              his Elks building.
              He was
              convinced the three of us would be ideal in the creation of Bellingham's best new restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>It was a simple arrangement. Dick would provide the main floor at a reasonable rental fee, and permit us
              to use the kitchen equipment without additional cost. We would be at liberty to make use of the space as
              we saw fit.
              What we had to work with was a front bar with street-facing windows; a front side room also with
              street-facing windows; a central main-dining area; and kitchen in the back. While my ex and I labored to
              ready the business, Dick would work with the local bureaucracy in securing the necessary permits, and
              bring
              the building to code.

            <h4>Dorked 2</h4>
            <p>
              It took close to a year and a fair bit of credit card-borrowed cash to convert the rather run down bar and side space
              (the initial target for opening) into what my ex and I thought an interesting and inviting place for
              social interaction, wine, cocktails and food.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bar, previously a dingy, insipid off-white shell with overly bright lighting, was now painted in
              tan
              and maroon, with soft canned lighting, solid pine barstools, and small, golden wood tables of my own
              making.
              The side room, previously also a drab vanilla shell, now had a rustic english library theme with
              hardbound-stocked
              bookshelves, wood-simulated wallpaper, a working gas fireplace, a comfy couch, and a beautiful,
              ornately carved upright grand piano.
              Wood-framed prints of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and other great composers decorated the walls, and
              for
              this space I also constructed solid wood tables, though slightly smaller and mahagony toned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interspersed throughout the finished spaces were hidden speakers from which was to be piped soft
              classical
              and baroque music as a mainstay, but with occasional mellow rock and non-blaring jazz as well. The
              establishments chosen name was <em>Arpeggio.</em> The cuisine primarily French and Italian.
            </p>
            <p>As the main area already had the foundation for appropriate ambiance (including dark-hued carpeting,
              marbled-toned pillars and chandelier lighting) the next phase was already being planned. And with only
              a
              few simple additions needed - tables and chairs, a small service bar, and shelving for wine
              bottles, stemware, etc. - we did not foresee much difficulty in its completion. The kitchen and
              bathrooms
              were ready. Indeed to open the business, <em>we</em> were ready.</p>
            <p>
              Dick wasn't ready. Or more accurately, Dick's building wasn't ready. And never would be
                ready. At least for my ex and I. Yeah, we got Dorked. </p> 
              <p>
               There was always one complication or another preventing Dick from readying his building to
                  the satisfaction of the city. Often lamented by him in his stream of consciousness manner, and at
                  times also under a heavy influence of pot. We waited and waited but at length needed to move on. At
                  some point I had the idea of opening a wine shop, and by way of atonement Dick offered me a few months
                  free rent in another of his buildings. One not in need of further bureaucratic
                  approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wine shop faired reasonably well. And after a year or so I moved the inventory into a larger,
              nearby
              space - this one not owned by Dick. And with some of the moveable stuff from Arpeggio, my ex and I
              soon
              after opened a restaurant/wine shop business.
            </p>
            <p>
              And not terribly long thereafter, a restaurant in the old Elks building was at long last open.

              I cannot profess to know whether it was to the city of Bellingham, or to Dick himself that Giuseppe made
              the unrefusable "offer". I merely know that at his opening time Dick was still the Elks' owner, and that
              clearly all hoops necessary to jump through had been satisfied. It could have just been a modest payout to
              the right official within Bellingham's bureaucratic maze. A simple remedy I clearly had not considered.
            </p>
            <p>
             One night I decided to go in for dinner. As I sat at the bar and looked around I
                noticed Giuseppe hadn't changed much in the bar or the library room. And that his finishing of the main
                dining area was not really much different than what my ex and I planned. By all accounts the business
                did well in the Elks building, until moving into a larger location on the waterfront. I guess my partner
                and I were on the right track.

            <h4>Catch and Release</h4>
           <p>Of all the fine people whom I have had the pleasure of working with, among my
              favorites was Knute.</p>
              <p>
                Knute was one of the line cooks working at the previously noted Italian restaurant when there I began
                employment.
              </p>
              <P>Mid-twenties and a guitarist in a local heavy metal band, Knute admirably copped the requisite
                rebellious
                attitude of a hard rocker, and with shoulder-length straight blond hair, looked the part as well. But
                beneath the bad boy veneer was a young man of substantial charm and likability, in addition to being a
                solid and conscientious laborer.</P>
              <p>
                Knute's girlfriend at the time, "Linda", was the restaurant's principle hostess. Blonde as well, Linda
                was
                soft-spoken, slender, attractive and overtly sweet natured. And though very youthful for her age, Linda
                was clearly a fair bit older - perhaps by a decade or more - than Knute. But regardless of age
                discrepancy
                they seemed compatible and happy with each other. And sufficiently committed to the relationship to live
                together, which they did at Linda's house in the rural outskirts of Bellingham.

                Time, however, has a way of scratching through veils of falsehood. And with regards to the unveiling of
                the present micro drama, I played an unwilling, though central, role.

                    A few years ago I found out I had nightshade allergies. Since then I've learned how nice pasta can
                    be
                    without tomato. With just sauteed garlic, olive oil, parmesan, salt and black pepper,
                    pasta is quite good. Some of my preferred vegetarian additions would include artichoke hearts,
                    spinach, sauteed leeks, corn, kalamata
                    olives, green onions. If meat is desired toss in some good sausage; or top with a crispy chicken
                    thigh
                    or roasted lamb chop.

            <h4>Catch and Release 2</h4>
            <p>
              After a few months working with Knute, it became increasingly apparent that his sweet, pretty girl had
              considerably more intrest in me than the guy she was living with. Perhaps thinking I had designs on her as
              well, or maybe out of a more general displeasure with the unraveling of his love life, Knute, towards
              myself, became increasingly unfriendly. This saddened me. As previously stated, I really liked Knute. And
              beyond a typical male appreciation for an attractive gal, in Linda I had no interest. And if I had,
              knowing full well Knute's intense and abiding affection for her, I would not have acted on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After work one Fourth of July night, a bunch of the restaurant's staff gathered on a nearby rooftop to
              watch the fireworks over Bellingham Bay. I was sitting apart from the group and watching the show, when
              suddenly Linda sat beside me and placed her head on my shoulder. I knew Knute was in visible proximity and
              watching. I can't deny the thrill of feeling a beautiful female face so close to mine, but even stronger
              was the empathetic humiliation I felt for Knute. I scooted over enough to disengage contact, as Knute
              approached and sat on the other side of Linda. Thus we remained, in silence, until the fireworks ended.
            </p>
            <p>At a party following, Linda continued to openly ply me with her considerable charms, well knowing the
              unsettling effect it was having on Knute.</p>
            <p>But between Linda and I nothing of a romantic nature ever transpired. And as it turned out another line
              cook was hired who soon after became the object of Linda's amorous attention, and subsequent house mate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometime hence at a bar with some co-workers, I was eves-dropping on a conversation between Linda and a
              waitress. At one point during the exchange Linda was asked how she felt about dumping Knute, and hooking
              up with the new beau.
            </p>
            <p>"Well things are going pretty good," chuckled Linda. "You know, it's all part of the catch and release
              program."</p>
            <h4>***</h4>
            <p>
              In time - and in addition to an already operational wine shop - my (second) ex and I were the overstressed
              owners of a downtown Bellingham restaurant. Du Jour Bistro was the restaurant's name, and the wine shop,
              "The Vines."
            </p>
            <p>I was good at, and very much liked, the wine business. So after getting the restaurant open and running,
              It was my intention to bring on a chef to take charge of the kitchen.</p>


          </div>
          <div class="col catch3">
            <p id="center">43</p>
            <h4>Catch and Release 3</h4>
            <p>
              One night Linda came in, with yet a different catch, to check out the new place and have dinner. Upon
              dining, the new catch was impressed. And having heard of the available chef job, afterwards hustled back
              to the open kitchen to meet me, convey his enthusiastic compliments, and offer to fill the position. He
              turned out to have talent, and was hired.
            </p>
            <div id="wild">
              <p>“"Chefs are nutters. They're all self-obsessed, delicate, dainty, insecure little souls, and absolute
                psychopaths. Every last one of them."

                -Gordon Ramsay.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The chef ultimately didn't work out, and wasn't for long. But one thing I found quite interesting about
              him was his frequently rude, in a passive way, treatment of Linda. I first observed this one night after
              closing, when he sat with my visiting sister, my ex, and I for at least an hour, while Linda sat alone and
              uncomfortable across the room.
              And on several occasions after, he did likewise with other friends or acquaintances.
              He seemed to take genuine pleasure in making his girl look and feel awkward.
              (I say girl but at this time in Linda's life it was obvious her forever-young catches were now at an age
              discrepency sufficient to be her offspring, as indeed the new bistro chef undeniably was).
            </p>
            <p>
              But as stated, the young chef's tenure was not to last, and after a few months he moved on. And I was
              again doing hard labor in an increasingly busy kitchen. Oh well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business lasted about ten years, with the initial half marked by success, followed by a frustrating
              period of setbacks and decline. Eventually circumstances necessitated closing the business and selling all
              inventory. And I then began preparations to move to South America.</p>
            <p>Throughout the intervening years of business ownership, it wasn't uncommon for me to cross paths and
              briefly visit with Knute. The long hair and hard rock attitude evolved into a short crop, trimmed beard
              and mustache, and an affable maturity suggestive of a guy enjoying a fun, successful life. Which, as the
              owner of a popular Paella catering company, he evidently was.
              And though the initial encounters were somewhat strained, in time any antipathy for past events was
              forgotten or left behind..
            </p>
            <p>A short while before my departure South, I ran into Linda outside the local food Co-op. It was a sunny
              spring afternoon and as we neared I noticed that, though still with some waning attributes of youth and
              beauty - the styled, blonde-colored hair; the slender (though slightly bent) figure; the overtly sweet
              demeanor - her face had become old. And her eyes bespoke the sadness of a woman whose halcyon days of
              catch and release were over.

            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves</h4>

            <p>Mr. Bigs was the de facto patron saint of hospitality in Bellingham.
              A towering, tremendously successful businessman, he was regularly seen in one local eatery or another at
              which he invariably spent freely and tipped well. And, thankfully, this did include Du Jour Bistro.
              I liked Mr. Bigs. Though filthy rich and treated as royality, in addition to his generosity, he was always
              polite and respectful. And As with many of the local ownership, Mr Bigs was on friendly terms with my ex
              and I.
            </p>
            <p>
              One night around closing time, Mr. Bigs popped in with a lady friend and joined myself and ex., and a few
              bistro staff, for a bottle of wine. He and his friend "Jenny" had just been to a recently opened
              restaurant and were quite enthusiastic over the experience. Just north of the Canadian border in the small
              seaside town of White Rock, the restaurant was an upscale, white tablecloth sort called <em>Pearl.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Amid their enthusiastic recounting, Jenny then suggested a return visit in which all currently seated go
              together. Readily agreeing to the suggestion Mr. Bigs then said it would be his treat, and extended the
              invitation to include present company spouses as well.

              <p> Corked wine has nothing to do with the physical integrity of the cork. It is a chemical contamination
                usually occurring in the cork itself, or sometimes in a part of the winery at which the wine was made. A
                small amount of cork taint results in a wine with muted flavors and aromas. A larger amount in a
                disgusting, mildewy smell and taste. It is estimated somewhere between 3 and 5 percent of wines using
                traditional corks (made from tree bark) have some degree of cork taint. Cork taint does not
                discriminate. It can ruin that 8 buck Trader Joes Merlot, or $1000 Bordeaux you've been cellaring for a
                decade.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The group was 8. I brought along a case of wine to sample with the food. Mr. Bigs had a large vehicle with
              chauffeur, so getting trashed wasn't an issue.
              It was summer when we arrived, and the sun was shining in the beautiful resort town.

            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 2</h4>
            <p>Upon entering, the host espied the case of wine I was carrying, and offered to take it for safe keeping.
              I gave him the box and as he shuffled away I asked to please begin chilling the two bottles of Chablis
              that were within. Mr. Bigs was greeted enthusiastically by all. Of course they remembered him. His
              generosity never failed to impress.</p>
            <p>
              We were seated at a white-clothed table laden with polished settings and cristal stemware. Mr. Bigs sat on
              one end flanked by my ex and Jenny. I sat on the other next to the Bistro's sous chef and his wife. In the
              center were two bistro servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A bus boy came to fill water goblets, and I reiterated my request to have the Chablis chilled, and that we
              intended to have it with a round of oysters. He promised to check on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A server came inquiring about beverage starters. I told him of the Chablis I brought, and asked him to
              please get it on ice and bring it to the table.
              He said he'd check on it. I ordered the oysters.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Would you like caviar as well?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinking caviar would also be nice with the Chablis I agreed. The waiter nodded and shuffled off. Out of
              curiosity I flipped open the menu to check out what kind of caviar they had. It was Beluga. And
              <em>very</em> expensive.
            </p>
            <p>After a few minutes the server returned and announce a corkage policy of $25 per opened bottle. It was a
              bit steep, but I told him that would be fine.</p>
            <d>
              Another staff member approached and told me that in addition to the $25 corkage fee, for each bottle of

                "You must be kidding," I said.</p>
              <p>
                "I'm not," he said.</p>
              <p>
                "Can I see the manager?" I asked.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm the manager," he answered. "And the sommelier."
              </p>
              <p>
                I got up and approached Mr. Bigs, who was talking animatedly with the two flanking girls. They were
                pretty girls and Mr. Bigs liked pretty girls. I told him the corkage fee was a bit exorbitant. He said
                not to worry about it, and to just get some wine to the table. I resumed my seat.

            <p>
              The oysters and caviar arrived. I jumped up and hustled over to the host.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Could you <em>please</em> have someone send over the Chablis on ice?"
            </p>
            <p>"Let me check on that, he said."</p>
            <p>
              A couple minutes later the Sommelier arrived with the 2 bottles of Chablis in a bucket of ice.
            </p>
            <p>"How about a couple bottles of Krug Champagne?" He inquired, opening the Chablis.</p>
            <p>
              I grabbed the wine list and scanned the champagnes. The Krug was $700.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I don't think so," I said, flipping to the Canadian white wine section. "Bring me 2 bottles of Mission
              Hill Pinot Gris."
            </p>
            <p>
              "The Krug will be better with the oysters," he said, visibly offended by my selection.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I think the Gris will be fine," I countered.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The Krug will be <em>much</em> better with the oysters," he insisted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chablis had still not been poured, and the ice beneath the plated oysters was melting. I suspected Mr.
              Bigs was getting impatient.
            </p>
            <p>"Could you please pour the Chablis," I said, nodding in the direction of Mr. Bigs. "And then bring the
              Gris."</p>
            <p>
              At last relenting on the Krug sale, the Sommelier slithered over to Mr. Bigs and began pouring the wine.
            </p>
            <p>The oysters and caviar were nice, and paired wonderfully with the Chablis. In short order the Sommelier
              arrived with the Pinot Gris.</p>
            <p>"Would you care for a round of <em>Foie Gras?"</em></p>
            <P>"I don't think so," I said. "There are a couple bottles of Cristom Pinot in the case I brought that I'd
              like opened. And please send the waiter to take our orders."</P>
            <p>"Got it. So was that a yes on the of <em>Foie Gras</em>?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col bigs4">
            <p id="center">47</p>
            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 4</h4>
            <p>
              <p>"King crab with truffle butter?"</p>
              <p>
                "No thanks."
              </p>
              <p>"It's very nice...."</p>
              <p>"I'm sure, but I think everyone is ready to order. And please don't forget the pinot. "</p>
              <p>
                The Sommelier left and shortly after arrived the waiter. As it was with the Sommelier, with
                <em>everything</em> ordered came an aggressive suggestion, and sometimes insistance, of an expensive
                accompaniment. Already inured to the sleazy tactics, I refused every enticement, and simply ordered a
                salad and entree. But most of the others played into the game and acquiesced to a topping of shaved
                truffles, slice of lobster <em>pat&egrave;</em>, Kobe tenderloin slider, etc. Thinking of the whopping
                bill to come, I could only imagine the damage.
              </p>
              <p>The Sommelier then showed up with the pinot, both bottles already opened and one minus a generous
                sampling.</p>
              <p>"How's the Cristom," I asked.</p>
              <p>"Nice. And by the way, the corkage policy has changed. It's $35 plus two from the house."</p>
              <p>It was blatant thievery.</p>
              <p>
                "And if you'd like another pinot, I would recommend the La Romanee;"
              </p>
              <p>"Of course you would. Look man, this is...seriously unethical...I'm in the business...have never seen
                anything like it...."</p>
              <p>"What do you care, <em>you're</em> not paying."</p>
              <p>"But you really can't do this just because a guy's rich."</p>
              <p>
                "Sure I can."
              </p>
              <p>I looked over to Mr. Bigs. Now with a two-glass buzz his gregarious animation had infected almost
                everyone seated. He was the center of attention, in his element, and having a blast. I felt certain he
                would would have resented - even been insulted - were I to again interrupt over a cost concern. But I
                sure as hell wasn't going to agree to La Romanee at $2400 a pop.</p>

                One day at the wine store a woman entered and approached me at the front desk. The previous night she
                had been to a wine-tasting gathering. The South African Cabernet she brought, which I had recommended
                and sold to her, was crap. "Smelled and tasted like old rot." All agreed it was bad. She was embarrassed
                and humiliated. I knew the wine, knew it was, normally, a good wine; and said that she had unfortunately
                received a corked bottle. She insisted there was nothing wrong with the cork. I explained (as above)
                that it wasn't <em>the</em> cork, but something <em>in</em> the cork. A contamination <em>of</em> the
                cork. It didn't sink in. I asked her to bring in the bad bottle for a replacement. She said she was so
                disgusted she poured it out and threw the bottle away. No, she didn't save the receipt. She just wanted
                to know how I could recommend such a <em>bad</em> wine. She never returned.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              I snatched the wine list and ordered an assortment of Okanagan reds - some of the lesser expensive on the
              list. The Sommelier smirked, said margin was highest on the Canuck juice, and disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>A short while later the table was teeming with bottles, stemware, and food laden plates of all sizes.
              When the entrees and sides were consumed Mr. Bigs called for a dessert menu, and I was tasked with an
              accompanying beverage.</p>
            <p>Not caring much for sweets, I got the attention of the Sommelier, and asked that he bring one of the two
              bottles of a nice Chateauneuf Du Pape from my case. A couple of glasses of which, for me, would be a more
              agreable conclusion. And for the two required house wines I requested an off dry Prosecco.</p>
            <p>"Well we have a decent Prosecco, but the <em>Sauterne</em>, now that's to die for."</p>
            <p>"Just bring the Prosecco, please."</p>
            <p>"You just don't get it," he said, smiling, but with more than a little contempt.</p>

            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 6</h4>
            <p>
              So we ate, drank, laughed and slurred through the meal's termination. Upon his delivery of the dessert
              wines, I asked the Sommelier to return to me the case that was so curiously absconded with upon arrival.
              He nodded.
            </p>
            <p>When the bill was delivered I made a point to observe. Mr. Bigs merely glanced at it, then appeared to
              fill in the tip section and scribble his signature. His look of relaxed enjoyment not altering in the
              least.</p>
            <p>
              Of course the Sommelier did not return to me the case. And of course, upon exiting I had to insist to the
              host to get it. He did, and after being handed the top-folded box, I joined the group outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              When back home it occurred to me to open the case and check. And indeed, of the 7 full bottles that should
              have remained, there were only 4, along with some empties. Among the missing were some pretty good wines,
              including the second Chateauneuf Du Pape - a considerably more costly bottle. I wasn't really surprised.

                An amiable Italian named Giovanni Nardoni would occasionally come in to the bistro/wine store to sell
                his wine and sometimes have a meal. One night he came in with his wife and announced they both wanted

                write you a recipe...." Of course I could, and did make the pasta. They were both visibly pleased.
                Afterwards he thanked me and handed me a slip of paper. It read: <u>PASTA CON AHO Y OLIO.</u> PASTA,

                The following scan insertions are of a newsletter I wrote (one of several) detailing occurrances, factual or otherwise, at Du Jour Bisto. This one focuses on the bistro's generous policy of selling bottled wine to restaurant patrons at retail plus 5 dollars, and how occasionally the policy was considered deceiving or dishonest. It also reveals the then full time staff members, along with relevant, um,  abilities.

              <p><u>Cust:</u> Well, I really wanted the Iowine.</p>
              <p><u>Merch</u>: I see. Then I suggest the next time you're in Iowa, buy a few extra. Then when you want some more it'll be on hand. Now, if you'd like me to recommend something other than Iowine...?</p>
              <p><u>Cust:</u> No thanks. But I appreciate the great advice. And the next time in Iowa, I'm going to bring back some Iowine.</p>

                  <p><u>Merch</u>: Well I can assure you that you are, to my thinking, the ideal customer. I wish there were more like you. So would you care for a recommendation?</p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> No thanks. I've found what I needed. (Grabs a cheap red). This is a nice little wine.</p>
                  <p><u>Merch</u>: Yes, a nice little wine. Excellent.</p>

                A good friend and customer invited me to his house for dinner, shortly before my departure to South America. Also invited was a neighbor of his, a woman who was a semi-regular wine customer of mine as well. She brought with her a bottle of Leonetti Cabernet, one of the most coveted Washington wines at the time. She poured me a glass which was, to me, noticably corked. When she saw that I wasn't drinking it she asked why. I explained that it was corked, an off bottle, and that it was just an unfortunate part of the wine business. She didn't understand and as the night wore on seemed increasingly offended. I suspected were I to have continued on with the B'ham wine store, she would no longer have been a customer.

                <p><em><b>Two young women enter the shop, conversing.</b></em></p>
                <p><u>1st Woman:</u> It was at a party at Gwenns when I had it, and it was so good. I mean, they were all good, but this one was really good.</p>
                <p><u>2nd Woman:</u> Oh right, I heard about that. Outdoors, and catered too.</p>
                <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Yep. And the food was pretty good. But after the party was over I just remember thinking how great that wine was. (Merchant approaches).</p>
                <p><u>Merch:</u> Help you find anything?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> I hope so. I was at this party and had a great wine. It was so good.</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Nice. Do you recall the name?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Unfortunately not. I'm not that good with names.</p>
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Understood. Well, was it French...? Italian...? Domestic...?</p> 
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> I think it was maybe...from...gosh, was it from...? Not sure. Drawing a blank.</p>
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Oh. Well then, what did the lable look like? Was there a kangaroo on it?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Um, it was pretty dark. Not really sure. I don't remember a kangaroo.</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Do you recall the variatal? Cab? Merlot? Syrah?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> No idea. Guess I should have asked.</p>
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Hmmm. Was it floral, like a gewurtztraminer? On the sweet side? Rich and buttery like a big chardonnay?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Well, it was kind of sweet, but dry. And very smooth.</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Sweet but dry. Now I'm stumped. Was it red or white?</p>
                  <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Actually I don't know. But it was so good.</p>

                  <p><em><b>A woman enters the shop and after looking around a bit approaches merchant.</b></em></p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> Excuse me.</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Yes?</p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> Have you heard of a wine called Butter Hill White Zinfandel?</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Why, no. Please tell me about it.</p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> Oh, it's my all-time favorite wine! It's a little sweet, and not really white but light pink. And tastes sorta like cotton candy, but better.</p>
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> I was kidding. Of course I've heard of it. Haven't had the displeasure in years. But, yes,  I know the wine.</p> 
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> Oh, ok. So do you carry it here?</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> No I do not. But I do have an assortment of excellent ros&egrave;s. Perhaps not at the level of <em>cotton candy,</em> but.... Now take this one from Provence, a Bandol made from a blend of Grenache and Mourvedre. Just look at that beautiful salmon color. It is at once round, full, fruity, light, dry and refreshing. Give it a chill and it will pair with just about anything: Burgers, grilled vegetables, Indian food, Chinese, salmon, barbecue, sandwiches. At $24 a bottle it is admittedly not cheap, but if you wish to spend less, check out this Spanish pink. Made from 100% tempranillo, a principal red grape of Spain, it is deeper in color than the Bandol, and a bit fatter and less refined on the palate. But still fresh, and delicious and not at all palate cloying. And will pair as well with a wide variety of food. And this gem is only $7.99, not much more than your white zin, right?</p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> That's all great, but I really just want the Butter Hill.</p> 
                  <p><u>Merch:</u> Of course you do. </p>
                  <p><u>Cust:</u> And I just thought a nice store like this would have it.</p>

                    <p><u>Merch:</u> How flattering. But as you surely must know beside this <em>nice</em> store, that wine is sold everywhere. Everywhere!  Every grocery store, corner market and gas station across the country stocks it. And how is that even possible? Because it's mass produced like a soda pop, and to be frank the so-called wine is shit. Now why would I want bottled shit in my <em>nice</em> store, hmmm? And now that you know I do not have any of the disgusting concoction that you are so embarrassingly enamored of, <em>and why,</em> is there anything else I might help you find?</p>

                    <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> I don't either. But I had a Merlot at Jordan's last weekend that I liked. I think it was called Yellow Dog.</p>
                    <p><u>1st Girl:</u> Never heard of that. Anyway, my sister's 30th birthday's coming up and I want to get her something nice. She's actually taken classes on wine appreciation, and likes the good stuff, especially champagne.</p>
                    <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> Yeah? Have you ever had a champagne cooler?</p>
                    <p><u>1st Girl:</u> No. But I like wine coolers. Let's see...champagnes....here they are. I want to get her a real nice one. One that'll blow her away.</p>
                    <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> How about this one... how do you even say that? "Voov Clickot?" That's almost $60! Who would spend that much on one bottle of wine? And look at some of these others, they're even more!</p>
                    <p><u>1st Girl:</u> My sister spends that much all the time, at least ever since she got that tech job. But I want to get her something <em>really</em> good.</p>
                    <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> Hey look over there, that's the wine I had at Jordans. Yellow Tail. That's right. And here's a note about it. (Reads) "I personally do <u>not</u> care for this wine, which tastes of cooked fruit, cheap vinification and saccharine. But since I get so many requests, I brought some in. Enjoy!" Weird. Well I like it. Why don't you get her a bottle of this?</p>
                    <p><u>1st Girl:</u> Nope, it's gonna be champagne. And I've got a hundred bucks to spend on it.</p>
