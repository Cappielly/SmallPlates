            <h4>Eric's New Hat</h4>
            <p>
              Eric came in through the back kitchen entrance with a big smile and new addition to his cook’s uniform: a
              just-purchased secondhand chef’s hat. Acquired at a nearby thrift store, it was one of the erect,
              starched-linen types with long vertical folds. Well used it no longer had the crisp white appearance of a
              new hat, but rather a faded yellow-beige hue. In squared black capital letters the front of
              the hat's elastic band bore the phrase "KISS THE COOK." Thus, of course, the smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              As he prepared for dinner service, Eric appeared both amused and pleased by his new acquisition. And he
              confided to his line-cook brethren, myself included, that he was looking forward to test the effectiveness
              of the hat’s bidding on a certain waitress of undeniable beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point during the afternoon I took a glance at Eric’s hat and was struck by an idea. Then, shortly
              before the arrival of the dinner servers, I put my idea into action by plucking a hair from my head
              and snipping off a small section of beige-colored labeling tape. With both hair and tape concealed in my
              hand, I then approached Eric.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s a great hat Eric,” I said. “but there’s a hair stuck right on the front of it.”
              I then brought my cupped hand up to his hat and lightly tapped in the piece of tape. Lowering my hand I
              then showed him the hair, easily passing for one of his own, before letting it fall to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thanks,” he said, “If that wound up on a plate it could have traumatized someone. Maybe even cost me my
              job”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Very true,” I replied, chuckling at the hyperbole. Then stepped back to review my work. Yes indeed, at
              only a short distance the masking tape was virtually invisible. It only slightly impaired the lettering's
              evenness, and was a near perfect match to the hat’s time-worn coloring.
            </p>
            <p>
              The night servers then began to enter the dining room, which was separated from the kitchen by a couple of
              swinging saloon doors. Soon they would be coming into the kitchen and interacting with the cooks as part
              of their work routine. I looked to Eric and noticed a slightly stifled grin spread on his face as the
              voice of a certain
              undeniably beautiful sever was heard approaching the saloon doors. And as he prepared for the surprised
              giggle - perhaps even a peck on the cheek - in response to his hat's invitation (KISS THE COOK); I braced
              for the likely very
              different, and indeed wholly unpredictable response to:

              Of himself, Musician Richard Strauss was reported to have said: “I may not be a first-rate composer, but I
              am a first-class second-rate composer."
            </p>
            <p>
              Substitute chef for composer and this aptly describes myself. I have worked in many good restaurants and
              learned from some very good chefs. I have also owned a couple of decent restaurants at which I was the
              menu's creator and principle cook, thus chef by default. And once - albeit at a mangy, dying place of
              which I was ashamed to be part of - I even held the esteemed position.
            </p>
            <p>
              But personally I could not care less for the title, nor have ever enthusiastically lobbied for the job.
              Cooking became a vocation more out of immediate opportunity than any career-oriented forethought or
              passion for the craft. Learning to cook well has certainly been a benefit to myself, to those for whom I
              have cooked, and those for whom I have worked. But I have very seldom spent non-working hours studying
              different culinary techniques, and devising ways to produce ever-improved food concepts, as first-rate
              chefs invariably do.

              And though my cooking/hospitality experience (I've done it all) certainly has not made me rich, nor my
              future secure, it has introduced me to many interesting places, circumstances, and people. And,
              embellished with an assortment of quotes and chef tips, (second-rate, of course) that’s
              what this modest work is about:
              Written snapshots -
              literary small plates - of a first-class second-rate chef.

            <h4>Button Button 1</h4>
            <p>I took my first restaurant job at the age of 15. It was a hole-in-the-wall place called La Provencal
              in downtown Kirkland, Washington. The exterior was just a plain, ground-level rectangle with a charcoal
              awning and an alley to
              the left that led back to the small, dingy kitchen. Inside, though, the house was nice. Two candle lit
              rooms, one for regular dining the other for private parties. Dark wood furniture, wine-colored carpeting.
              Part rustic, part elegance.
            </p>
            <p>The owner, Philipe, was French and spoke with a heavy french accent. The waiters were French, and spoke
              with heavy french accents. There were two chefs. One a 20 something sadist named Larry. The other a chubby
              Mexican called Rios. Another cook, the “salad boy,” was Dave Jepeski. A blonde, lanky guy with a jacked up
              Nova who was always flapping off.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plate washers were a couple of snooty high school senior babes. They worked a small, circular
              commercial dishwasher, and performed menial prep tasks like peeling garlic and potatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              My office was the pot and pan sink - to the immediate right of the chefs, the hot flat top, and gas
              burners. My tools of the trade water, soap and scrubbers. No machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was not a good kid at that stage of my life. A liar, thief, bad student, worse son. And I did drugs.
              Lots of ‘em. But somehow I managed to make it through the job’s first month or so without getting the axe.
              Even though I usually showed up with a dope-addled brain.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was on call one afternoon, hanging out with a friend who had managed to score some peyote, a yet untried
              experience. I had been on call a couple times before, and they never needed me. I figured they wouldn’t
              this night either. So going along with my friend I scraped the mildewy fuzz off some of the buttons and
              popped ‘em.
            </p>
            <p>
              A little while later I called the restaurant. The owner answered and told me to come in. It was gonna be a
              busy night.

            <h4>Button Button 2</h4>
            <p> It was a two mile walk to the restaurant, and I cursed the whole way. I hated the place, hated the work.
              And resented the idea of a good high interrupted. But after doing my first tasks, vacuuming the front and
              setting up the pot and pan area, my mind was still clear. Bad peyote, I supposed. Or not peyote at all.
              Really didn't know.</p>
            <p> Before dinner the service staff was allowed to eat and goof off a bit before resuming work. After
              finishing
              a plate of Daube, a sort of french beef stew, I stepped outside with Jepeski. He pulled out a bag of
              Colombian Gold and stuffed some in a pipe. I told him I popped some peyote buttons earlier but
              nothing was happening. He lit the pipe, inhaled, and offered it to me.</p>
            <p>“Something will happen now," he said, exhaling smoke. We made short work of the bowl and went back in. It
              was good weed. I was nice and stoned and started slogging through my work.</p>
            <p>So how you doin’ kid,” Rios asked, knowing, as all kitchen staff and probably waiters too, that me and
              Jepeski were lit. So what. A little buzz. I could still work.
            </p>
            <p>“I’m doing just...”
              The peyote kicked in.
              “Whaa...?”<br />
              “Yeah, I know kid. Tough question. Just try an' keep up. We gonna need stuff ASAP.”</p>
            <p>Don’t know why - probably shouldn’t have - but I drifted over to Jepeski and told him: “The peyote kicked
              in.” He looked at my face, into my eyes. “Wow, dude. You’re <em>seriously</em> baked. Got any more?”
            </p>
            <p>I was seriously baked.
              And within a few minutes all staff knew I was seriously baked. Flapping Jepeski.</p>
            <p>As one might imagine, a lot of details are gone. But some impressions of the ensuing, surreal hilarity
              remain:
              Repeated barks of "HOT!" just as Larry sent red-glowing pans crashing into the sink scalding my arms;
              freakish smells of burnt butter, frog legs, sauce velout&egrave; and pink detergent blasting up my nose;
              <em>tons</em> of charred, greasy metal needing attention "ASAP!"; senior babes snarking me behind my back;
              french-gibbering waiters peering into my wasted eyes, pleading for <em>le peyot&egrave;</em>....
            </p>
            <p> But I made it. Didn't get canned or even told not to get so baked at work. Just how the placed rolled.
              Going home probably made short work of another bowl with Jepeski in his jacked up Nova.</p>

            <h4>Nancy</h4>
            <p>It was a sunny late summer afternoon. Except for the lone woman seated at a table with a fine view of
              Lake Washington, the restaurant was empty. Observing her from the the opposite end of the dining room, the
              young server was struck by her apparent beauty. And by how much she reminded him of Nancy. For most of the
              previous year Nancy and he had been together, as happy as any two could hope to be.</p>
            <p>Prior to his time with Nancy, nearly all of his teen years had been a tragedy of drugs, lying and
              thievery. But during those wasted years he yet managed to keep his french restaurant job, advancing from
              dishwasher to pantry cook. And it was there, shortly after Nancy became employed as a hostess, where they
              met and began a relationship. And as their intimacy solidified her wholesomeness helped to change his
              self-destructive ways. Hence his mind was now clear, his days fruitful, his future bright. But since
              only a short time had elapsed since Nancy had been compelled to move quite far away, his thoughts were
              distracted, his heart heavy.</p>
            <p>Balancing a filled water goblet upon a circular tray, he approached the solitary customer. The nearer
              proximity revealed traits differing from Nancy, but also confirmed his more distant impression: she was
              beautiful. The shoulder-length of her hair was about the same as Nancy's and cast a similar golden
              sheen, but was styled with shorter, more defined waves. Her eyes a purer, darker blue than the grey-blue
              eyes of Nancy. The contour of her face was, like Nancy's, a pleasing elongated oval, but with a touch more
              prominence to her cheeks and chin. And though still possessing a vibrant youthful bloom, she was clearly
              older than Nancy, perhaps by six or seven years, he thought.</p>
            <p>"Good afternoon," he said, placing the goblet on the table. "How are you?"</p>

            <p>"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?"</p>

            <p>"I'm fine," he said, slightly unnerved by the undisguised affection that her steady gaze communicated.
              Following another brief pause and still in the magic of her warm, lovely gaze, he focused back on the job
              at hand:</p>
            <p>"Would you care for anything else at this time?"</p>
            <p>"No. Water will be fine until my friends arrive."</p>
            <p>The thought of her friends' arrival seeming to divert her attention from the server, she resumed looking
              out the window towards the lake. But as he turned to depart, she looked to him once more.</p>
            <p>"Thank you," she said. "You're very sweet."</p>

            <h4>Nancy 3</h4>
            <p>Turning to face her he again noted the genuine warmth and affection of her gaze as she held his eyes.</p>
            <p>Though his equilibrium suddenly shattered, he was yet able to mumble a shy "thanks" before she returned
              her
              attention to the lake.</p>
            <p>From the moment he met Nancy and indeed throughout their relationship, her presence invariably had a
              mellowing effect on his spirit. This was not a result of blunted interest or want of excitement, but
              rather a manifestation of profound compatibility. Similarly attuned to life and its vagaries they were, by
              extension, naturally attuned to each other. They were close in age and status, enjoyed many of the same
              activities and pleasantries, were alike in temperament, and physically and mentally complimentary. They
              were content together during idleness, play, passion or silence. With Nancy he was always at ease.</p>
            <p>It was a perfect contrast to how he now felt. And walking the length of the dining room to the waiter's
              station, the young server wasn't sure if he could complete the journey without toppling over. His heart
              raced, his limbs trembled, and his suddenly untethered mind reeled in a crazy delirium of alien
              intoxication. He knew nothing of this golden haired beauty, but her unabashed affection and simple
              compliment filled him with an intense blast of confusion and joy.</p>
            <p>Entering the wait station, young server began organizing for evening service when the head waiter
              arrived. Tall, charismatic, and a decade his senior, the head waiter was more than a little intimidating
              to the younger man, who typically was hesitant to initiate any conversation not related to the job. At
              this time, however, he needed to vent some of the emotion surging through his nerves. Hence overcoming his
              accustomed timidity, he paused briefly to compose his rambling thoughts and spoke:
            </p>
            <p>"There's uh, uh, a lady out there. Table 10. Very beautiful. Um, seems to like me."</p>
            <p>Moving to the doorless arch separating the wait station from the dining area, the head waiter peered in
              the direction of the lone customer. Then with an expression of amused disbelief looked back to his
              associate.</p>
            <p>"You don't know who that is?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"That's Nancy."</p>

            <p>"Oh come on, you can't be that sheltered. You never heard Magic Man....Crazy On You....Never heard of

            <p>"<em>Ahh.</em> Well yes. Sure I have. But she, she was really nice....Said I was--"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, well she is really nice. Just who she is. I know her. Sing back up for the band sometimes."</p>
            <p>"Really?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, really. And she really is just nice. Damn kid, what were you thinking...?"</p>
            <p>The young server looked on as the head waiter went to greet the rock star, now joined by her companions.
              Probably fellow band members, he thought, also noting the presence of her raven-haired rock star sister.
            </p>
            <p>Completing a couple more tasks in the wait station, the young server then reluctantly returned to the
              table, now a scene of fashionable camaraderie, and awkwardly placed goblets of ice water and baskets of
              bread among the chattering group.</p>
            <p>Unable to disregard the great chasm suddenly thrust between himself and the lovely woman whose prolonged
              gaze, only moments before, filled him with such delirium, he now endeavored to avoid eye contact. And
              likely aware that he must now know of her superstar ranking, she probably did as well. </p>

                section.
                Anne was very polite and pleasant. The only thing regarding the famous singer which stood out to me was

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head</h4>
            <p>Almost immediately upon his hiring at the upscale barbecue place, Chef Ned and I became friends. I had
              little cooking experience at the time, and by contrast, he was a veteran who previously worked
              side-by-side with two of the nation's rising star culinarians, Norman Van Aken and the late Charlie
              Trotter.</p>
            <p>The chef who hired Ned had talent and was also a friend, but youth, drinking
              and a volatile temper, made him ill-positioned for the job. It was therefor inevitable for the owner to
              let him go, and replace him
              with the more competent, and (thankfully) far easier-going Chef Ned. </p>
            <p>I learned a great deal from Ned, and with the aid of his extensive teaching - spanning four years and an
              equal number of restaurants - became a solid line cook. And for his mentoring and sharing of his
              considerable talent and experience I will always be grateful.</p>

                When making Crab or seafood cakes, rather than breadcrumbs, try using rice as a binder. It works,
                and tastes, <em>much</em> better. In a food processor just blend some cold basmati or jasmine rice and
                work in enough to the fish/seafood mixture to bind.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                Pure&egrave;d raw shrimp (or shrimp and rice) works good also.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                Make sure that whatever seafood for the cakes is used is very well dried.</p>
              <p>*Subtip*
                My preference is to avoid strong additions like peppers or zucchini. I've found
                A little saute&egrave;d onion or fennel along
                with lemon and tarragon makes the best cakes.

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head 2</h4>
            <p>An avid hiker during that period of my life, I would frequently recount my alpine experiences to the new
              chef while at work, and at some point he expressed an interest to join me on a future trek. Shortly after
              Ned and I planned a hike to lake Serene, a mountain-top jewel in the Northern Cascades, near Gold Bar
              Washington.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the lake's trail head we began our ascent and soon came upon a group of two couples sitting
              on
              a large rock slab overlooking a creek, a little off the left side of the path. Engaging our attention one
              of the group, a thirty-something guy, asked if we were were interested in buying a beer. Grinning he
              pulled a 40 ounce bottle of Old English 800 from a cooler. "Nice and cold," He said. We declined. The
              offer was a first in my hiking experience, but no further drama ensued with the beer guy nor his
              companions, and we got on with our hike.<p></p>
              <p>Upon our return, however, when only about half a mile from the trail head, gunshots suddenly began to
                report quite close to the vicinity of our descent.</p>
              <p>Attempting to alert the unseen shooter of our presence we repeatedly hollered down towards the gunshot
                sounds. But much to our increasing agitation the shooting commenced, off and on, until we arrived at the
                previously noted rock slab area. It was still occupied by the two couples but now the beer guy - clearly
                having partaken of more than a little of his malt - was brandishing a pistol about and, once again,
                blasting shots into a rocky area up the mountain side. And all in the group seemed to be taking boozy
                delight in his recklessness.</p>
              <p>Nearing the shooter I pleaded for a pause in the firing before hustling past him as quickly as
                possible. Only to then be stunned by a question from Ned, who lagged slightly behind:</p>
              <p>"Hey, you still got that beer?"</p>
              <p>Reloading his gun the beer guy grinned. "Sure do."<br />"Can I buy one?"<br />"Don't see why not. Come
                on
                over here."<br />

            <h4>The Day Chef Ned [Nearly] Lost His Head 3</h4>

            Amazed I watched as Ned strode closer to the armed, drunk, power-deranged beer
            guy.<br />"How much you want for it?"<br />"How much you willing to pay?"<br />Perhaps noting the beer
            guy's lurking malevolence, Ned seemed to finally grasp the danger.<br />"Oh, well," he said, his voice
            thinner, higher-pitched, "um...whatever you think is fair."<br />"Well gimme twenty bucks then," said the
            beer guy, and his friends laughed. Ned laughed too, nervously.<br />"Ha Ha. That's alright. Guess I'll get
            going now." And he turned to leave.<br />"You sure as hell wont!" Said the other, and fired up the
            mountain. "We still got some business to take care of."<br />Forced to stop and re-engage the beer guy,
            who now threateningly waved his pistol, Ned responded. "I...I don't have 20 dollars."<br />"Then make a
            counter offer, dipshit. <em>Negotiate."</em><br />"I...I only have four dollars, is that..."<br />"Four
            dollars! Are you trying to insult me, buddy?"<br />"No, man. That's really all I have." And he pulled out
            his wallet and removed the four dollar bills.<br />Momentarily glaring at Ned, the beer guy then looked to
            his friends."Should I let this dipshit rip me off?" They laughed. "That's up to you," a women
            said.<br />"Ok dipshit, lucky for you I'm in a good mood. Get over here and let's finish this
            deal."<br />It was only a few steps, but Ned walked slow, his legs wobbly. He handed over the
            money.<br /> Again glaring, the beer guy reached into the cooler, pulled out a forty, moved it towards
            Ned. Then grinned. "Here you go, dipshit."<br />Hand shaking, Ned took the bottle and turned.<br />"Ha!
            Ha! Ha!" The beer guy screamed, and positioning his pistol right behind Ned's head, fired several shots
            upward. "Ha! Ha! Ha!"
            </p>
            <p>I'll never forget the look on a man's face who believes he's suddenly going to die.</p>

            <h4>The Brothers Dumas</h4>
            <p>Charm has many forms, many facets, many faces. Though different in essence Alexander and Frederick Dumas
              were both enormously charm-gifted. Raised in the south Seattle hood, neither Alex nor Fred were inclined
              towards the rap-culture thuggery common to the area; preferring, rather, to interact with two distinct but
              equally effective versions of humor, and charm.</p>
            <p>The barbecue joint was located on a busy corner of Capitol Hill, Seattle, where Alex and Fred worked.
              Alex was a prep cook, Fred a dishwasher. After a few years working front house gigs, I was back in the
              kitchen, painting ribs and grilling steaks at the same place. Walnut-hued, medium height and fit, Alex was
              baritone-chatty, friendly, open, innocent. Fred was a shade darker, taller, leaner, and with a deeper
              voice that, though less active than his brother's had a tone of cleverness and irony. With only a slight
              alteration in demeanor or expression either could have looked intimidating, even menacing. But neither
              seemed suited towards, or interested in, being thus - their appearances invariably projecting geniality
              and humor.</p>
            <p>The restaurant's street level cooking line was behind the bar with an open view of the dining room and
              the busy Uptown streets beyond. During lunch and dinner service, myself and the other line cooks
              communicated by phone with the prep cooks and dishwashers, who worked in a spacious preparation area, one
              floor below. In need of a red onion during a busy lunch one day I phoned downstairs and Alex answered.</p>
            <p>"Dumas Diner, chef speaking," He joked.<br />
              "Hey Alex, can you bring up a red onion."<br />
              "Okay!"<br />
              "Need it quick, please."<br />
              "Alright!"</p>
            <p>It seemed too long a delay (when one is busy it always does, right?) but Alex finally did arrive. He gave
              me the onion. It was yellow. </p>
            <p>"Didn't I ask for a red onion?"<br />
              "Yeah, but those other ones are purple...."</p>
            <p>Funny. <em>and</em> charming.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col dumas2">
            <p id="center">13</p>
            <h4>The Brothers Dumas 2</h4>
            <p>If to insult seems to be the intention of the above anecdote then I have been misunderstood. Alex was a
              wonderful, genuinely amusing person. But as with us all there were times - largely due to his charming
              innocence - that his humor was not entirely intentional. And lest you think the brothers' names are
              falsified to mock, or - in the case of the last name "Dumas" - intended as a demeaning pun, (= Dumbass)
              you
              would be
              wrong on both points. Their names as here written, both first and last, are genuine.</p>
            <p>Other instances of Alex's charm, both witting and not, I could include in this brief portrait, but prefer
              to move on to one involving his brother Fred, who was equally ready and able to amuse.</p>
            <p>One night before a Holiday dinner event my good friend chef Ned, (First-class and first-rate)
              and I were on the upstairs line preparing a few turkeys. Needing some bread to make stuffing, I called the
              prep kitchen and in his deep bass voice, Fred answered:</p>
            <p>"Boiler room!"<br />"Hey Fred, can you bring up a loaf of bread?"<br /> "Sure. Need it
              tonight?"<br />"That's probably best, Fred."<br />"Ok, get my peeps right on it."</p>
            <p>Loaf in hand, Fred lumbered up to the line and dropped it on the counter. Then pointing to a bag
              of giblets next to one of the turkeys, asked:</p>
            <p>"That its balls?"<br /> "Sure is Fred," answered the chef.<br /> "Why they in the bag?"<br /> "In case
              anyone wants to eat 'em, I guess."<br />"Hmm. So where's its penis?"</p>
            <p>Skipping nary a beat chef Ned reached into the turkey and pulled out the neck bone.<br />Following a few
              seconds silence Fred shook his head and smiled.</p>
            <p>"Damn."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col pasta">
            <p id="center">14</p>
            <p>One side note regarding Fred. At some point during his employment at the BBQ place he began singing a
              made-up lyric in a sort of country style. The lyric went for a time thus: "<em>I don't need know help to
                starve to death."</em> And soon after with addition: <em>"I can do that all by myself."</em> Apparently
              a current babe was living off of his rather modest means. For years I kicked the initial lyric around in
              my head, and eventually decided to make a song of it. It's made with the use of a free music notation
              program, (Musescore) so isn't the best quality (especially the lyrics); and could definitely use some
              polishing. But for any curious click the link:</p>

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 1</h4>
            <p>It was un upscale brewery restaurant in downtown Seattle at which the celebrity chef was hired.
              That he refused to even taste the fine beer struck me as odd, but of little consequence. Of greater
              consequence was the veiled dislike he had for me from the very start of his employment; and which only a
              short time hence developed into undisguised hatred.</p>
            <p>I had been working at the place since before it opened, finishing the wooden dining tables, organizing
              the kitchen equipment, cleaning, etc. It was a beautiful place with wood-and-copper-fronted beer tanks
              inside a spacious, open dining area; and a gorgeous solid-copper, half-circle-shaped bar. The owner was
              British as were the lesser-carbonated, lightly-chilled ales. Once open I worked the grill and saut&egrave;
              stations at night, a key position. And I was very good at my job.</p>
            <p>My afore-mentioned friend, Ned, was the original chef, but upon securing a position with
              former colleague and rising-star-chef Norman Van Aken at a new Florida restaurant, he gave his notice and
              left. A solid replacement, chef Tom, was then hired, did an admirable job, and became on friendly terms
              with me as well. But after just a few months he gave his notice and began the interviewing process for
              another kitchen head.</p>
            <p>At some point during his interviews chef Tom told me that one interested applicant was something of a Los
              Angeles celebrity, having been sous (assistant) chef to Wolfgang Puck at one of Puck's successful
              ventures. I was intrigued and voiced my not insignificant support to hire him.</p>
            <p>Soon after chosen to be the restaurant's 3rd chef, the L.A. celebrity came on to the line to meet me. He
              was a gruff, somewhat neanderthal-esque looking dude and after a brief introduction in a growly voice
              asked:
            </p>
            <p>"So, does it get pretty hot in here?"</p>
            <p>The kitchen being open and adjacent to the temperature controlled dining area - hence clearly not a
              particularly hot cooking environment - the question seemed odd. I told him no, the kitchen wasn't
              particularly hot.</p>
            <p>"Does it get pretty stressful?"</p>

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 2</h4>
            <p>"Sometimes, but not more than any other line cooking job," I answered, again thinking the question odd,
              as though he was fishing for a certain response. During that first encounter I noticed as well that
              though he was smiling and acting friendly, something about his manner betrayed annoyance. And his eyes
              were hostile.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the L.A. chef was hired, another California guy was brought on to replace the General
              Manager. An openly gay San Franciscan, the new GM didn't seem to take a shine to me either.</p>
            <p>I imagine it is not unusual for new management to have some resentment for well-entrenched staff, as I
              was; and especially those with a strong and positive relationship with the owner - as I had. But whereas
              the new GM's mild annoyance seemed typical new boss/subordinate stuff, the chef's ever-mounting contempt,
              and attendant rudeness, badgering and temper flare-ups - towards me alone - were becoming increasingly
              <em>atypical</em> and concerning.</p>
            <p>One night, however, he came onto the kitchen line with a smile almost obscuring the hostility of his
              eyes,
              and began a conversation thus:</p>
            <p>"<em>Je pence donc je sui."</em></p>
            <p>Never having given him any indication that I spoke French, it was yet again another of the chef's
              conversational oddities. But at least the sham smile was back, so I played along and asked what he meant.
              Visibly proud of his achievement he translated the quote, "I think therefore I am," and told me the
              quote's author, Rene Descartes.</p>
            <p> How long he worked on this performance was hard to know, but it was clearly contrived and ill-suited his
              gruff, neanderthal manner. But the pretense of refinement seemed to ease his antipathy, and he went on to
              inform me that in addition to philosophy some of his other cultured enjoyments included painting, reading
              and classical music. Letting him know I was a reader and classical music enthusiast as well, a temporary
              truce seemed to ensue at which time he began a surprisingly normal line of inquiry.<p>
              </p>
              <p>"Hey I'm lookin' for a more permanent place to live around here," he said. "Tryin' to get an idea of
                some of the neighborhoods. Where do you live?"</p>
              <p>At the time I was living in a residential section of Capitol Hill, and so told him. </p>
              <p>"What's it like? Do you like it there?"</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col celebChef3">
            <p id="center">17</p>
            <h4>Celebrity Chef 3</h4>
            <p>I was living a few blocks up from the busy, central part of Capitol Hill. It was a quiet part of the
              hill, but there were some nice shops and restaurants within a couple of blocks; and the general area had a
              pleasing balance of greenery and interesting homes and buildings. I really liked living there, and told
              him. At the time Capitol Hill also had - likely still does - a notably large gay community, and I informed
              him of this as well. And of course there was the bustling central area replete of clubs, bars and eateries
              of all types, a stylish and unique shopping mall, and a couple of wonderful old-school movie theaters.
              Capitol Hill was an eclectic and exciting place for a youth such as myself. I really did like living
              there.</p>
            <p>Whether or not my enthusiasm for the place had any impact on the chef's decision, I never did find out.
              But as time passed there were things about <em>him</em> I absolutely did learn. First was that he was of
              that managerial breed which vastly prefers swinging a clipboard, yakking on the phone and basking in the
              schmooze of sales people, over any genuine labor. And that was probably a good thing since those rare
              times when he deigned to enter the cooking line and make a plate of food, it inevitably was an
              embarrassment to all but himself. And when the place was jammed and he was needed on the line he quite
              often fell apart. A good example of this occurred one evening prior to a late Seahawk's game, not long
              before my termination. The place was slammed. In spite of how busy it was I watched in awe as the
              celebrity chef struggled
              with a paltry order of two tomato-based seafood pastas. After placing the seafood into
              the pans he was then clearly befuddled over how to proceed. Embittered and ashamed, he reluctantly caught
              my eye and asked what to do.</p>
            <p>"De-glaze with wine and add the tomato sauce," I told him, "then finish with cream." He then commenced to
              babble repeatedly "yes, cream, cream!" while adding pasta, the <em>merest</em> amount of tomato and
              ladling in
              a ludicrous quantity of cream before slopping his
              finished work into bowls bound for two unfortunate patrons.</p>
            <p>Likely stinging from his observed incompetence, the chef never again tried to mask his seething
              animosity, and going forward even refused to speak to me. Meanwhile I was hearing from a couple of other
              line cooks how favored they were by the L.A. chef, and how according to him they were destined to become
              his new "dream team."</p>

            <h4>Celebrity Chef 4</h4>
            <p>I wasn't sure how the new chef was going to sell his decision to fire me, but the scent was
              in the air; the writing on the wall: I was on my way out.</p>
            <p>Soon after I received a call at my home from Richard, the owner, informing me that I was fired; that both
              the
              chef and GM said it needed to happen; and that as much as it distressed him, he had to respect their
              wishes. Instructing me to come in later to pick up my final check, he then said we could discuss further
              details of their reasoning if I wanted.</p>
            <p>I arrived at the restaurant in the evening and joined Richard who was sitting at the bar clasping a
              pint of blond ale. Upon telling him I did want to hear why I was fired he asked the bartender to bring me
              a pint, and in his cultured British-accent, started explaining.</p>
            <p>"The chef insists you're a homophobe, and has convinced the GM of it. He said you told him not to move to
              Capital Hill because of the prominent gay presence there. And said that you said gay people disgust you."
            </p>
            <p>It was incredible. "Um, really?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"But..you don't believe that...do you?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. Considering your friendship with Robin [a gay fellow line cook who indeed was a friend] it
              doesn't really make sense."</p>
            <p>"The chef is lying," I said, fury mounting and making it hard to speak calmly. "He's absolutely lying.
              Has wanted me gone since he was hired. Despises me."</p>
            <p>"I'm afraid I must respect their decision. It's because -"</p>
            <p>"But this is absurd," I cut in. "I told him I <em>like</em> living on Capitol Hill."</p>
            <p>"Did you say anything about the gay presence there?"</p>
            <p>"He asked me what it was like. I told him there was a large gay community. Never said they disgust me.
              I...I can't believe this."</p>

            <p id="center">20</p>
            <h4>Celebrity Chef 5</h4>
            <p>"Well the problem is the GM believes him - you know he's gay, right? - and they both consider it grounds
              for your removal. And since I did hire them to manage - to make the important decisions - it
              is necessary for me to show them my confidence. I'm very sorry."</p>
            <p>"But...Richard listen...<b>what that manipulative jackass of an incompetent chef said <em>isn't
                  true</em></b>....I <em>knew</em> there was something wrong with this guy... He's fucking off, Richard.
              Whacked. <em>Bad."</em></p>
            <p>For a while we thus continued but Richard would not relent. My argument was not to prevail. The celebrity
              chef would have his way.</p>
            <p>Finding another job was not an issue. Within a couple of weeks I was working the saut&egrave; station at
              an upscale Italian restaurant near the waterfront. A few months later I got a call from my friend Chef
              Ned,
              asking if I wanted to work with him at the latest Van Aken's venture. I absolutely did, and shortly after
              started the journey east. En
              route, however, about thirty miles west of Las Vegas my car caught fire and was destroyed. After three
              days mulling things over in Pahrump Nevada, I decided to take a rental car to beautiful Lake Tahoe, and
              try my luck there.</p>
            <p>I was a year in Tahoe and loved it. And would have remained had I not let a girl who I was then with
              convince me to move back with her to the northwest, so she could finish her studies at Western Washington
              University.</p>
            <p>Back in the Northwest, I eventually made it in to the brewery restaurant. The celebrity chef was gone. I
              asked Richard what had happened, and he said the chef got too burned out to handle things. After another
              year or so, I checked back and the place had changed ownership.</p>
            <p>Several years later I was working with a guy who had worked with the L.A. celebrity chef as well. He told
              me the reason for him leaving L.A. was due to some scandal he was embroiled in. Curious I later googled
              <b>L.A. celebrity chef,</b> and his name: <b>John Sweeney.</b> And among other tragic reporting, read
              this:</p>

            <h4>And She Called Me A Liar</h4>
            <p>It was a swank restaurant with lounge and tennis club in the heart of Incline Village, Lake Tahoe. I had
              only
              been in Tahoe a few days, and this was my first job interview. The chef was tall and direct, and in a
              strong, commanding voice asked me if I had cooking experience. "Yes." Then asked if I had <em>French</em>
              cooking experience. "Yes." Then told me I was hired and to start the following day. <em>Gard Manger</em>
              position. My job was line preparation of salads, appetizers and desserts.</p>
            <p>The chef's last name was identical in pronunciation to that of a then famous chef, one Roger
              Verg&eacute;, (Ver-<em>jhay)</em> and during one of my first days working with him, I asked if there was
              any relation. To my surprise he said there was, that Roger Verg&eacute; was his Uncle. Knowing nothing of
              the chef I had no reason to doubt him, but as the cloth-stenciled spelling on his chef's jacket didn't
              match that of my recollection of the French master's last name, I was a bit mystified. Out of curiosity
              the next day I went to the library and located one of Chef Verg&eacute;'s books. The spelling was, as I
              thought, different from that of my current boss. Quite different.</p>
            <p>The Tahoe Chef liked my work, and we soon became friends. He was a fine chef, professionally trained and
              gifted with an excellent palate and nose. He was also self-confident, tremendously charismatic, popular
              with women and at ease with the local celebrities. </p>
            <p>Before long we were goofing off together outside of work. Checking out new places to have lunch. Sneaking
              into the restaurant after closing hours to snag a bottle of wine, "<em>I've got a key!</em>." Dinner with
              the wives - I was recently married, he for a few years - playing blackjack at the Hyatt. And when winter
              arrived, skiing at one of the many nearby resorts. We had a lot of good times. He was great fun to be
              with. I
              really liked the guy. Even as it became clear that he really was a bad sort, and a big time liar.</p>

              Renaissance.” – Steven Wright</p>

            <p id="center">23</p>
            <h4>And She Called Me A Liar 2</h4>
            <p>To me it made no sense. He was popular and accomplished. There didn't seem to be any sound reason to
              fabricate his experiences or embellish his rich, active life, but that he did. Big time.</p>
            <p>Of course he was not nephew to Roger Verg&eacute;. Nor, as plainly evident by his clumsy skiing, had he
              ever been an instructor - though telling me he had. Nor was he a "semi pro" golfer, as claimed. (A waiter
              informed me that he was one of the worst golfers, if not <em>the</em> worst, he'd ever played a round
              with.)
              During
              spirited conversation many of his truth-sworn reminiscences, however funny and forcefully told, were
              obvious lies - at least to those who had come to know him. And in particular obvious to his sweet, adoring
              wife who, regardless of the falsehood's transparency would simply look to him smiling and say: "Oh,
              honey." But never once did I hear the veracity of his tales challenged. He was an emperor among subjects.
            </p>
            <p>As plentiful as his lies were the chef's infidelities. At length becoming both friend and confidant I
              was increasingly made familiar with the details of his cheating, as well as with some of the
              side-girls themselves who often would show up late at the restaurant before leaving with him.</p>
            <p>At some point the chef even rented a small apartment to more easily facilitate encounters with a new babe
              that he seemed especially fond of. Quite in opposition to his sweet, naive wife the current paramour - who
              was now regularly dropping by the restaurant - walked, dressed, laughed and generally behaved like a
              tramp. But there was no question regarding her allure. Clearly enamored, the chef even admitted to me that
              of all his side babes, she was the most exciting, and that he could even imagine divorcing his wife for
              her. A naturally happy, buoyant person, with this new hottie in his life he was positively elated.</p>
            <p>One day, however, he came to the restaurant in a very obvious funk. Quiet, sullen, brooding, I'd never
              seen him thus. After a few hours wondering what could be the cause of his distress, he told me his new
              girlfriend said she couldn't take him anymore, and broke up. Then looking to me with a wounded expression
              of sadness and offense, said:</p>

                My two best Tahoe friends were Joe and Matt. One summer night the three of us got loaded on Jaeger shots
                and decided to take a swim. It was breezy and the cold lake was alive with choppy waves. Undaunted and
                numb with booze we disrobed and jumped in. After bobbing about for a while we swam ashore, only to learn
                we
                had
                drifted from where our clothes were. And in the intense dark couldn't find them. After a few minutes
                bumbling around, Matt - a thick, beefy guy - became irritable and climbed up to the roadside. I don't
                recall exactly how long it took to find our clothes. But it was at least long enough for a couple dozen
                motorists to see a beefy, buck-naked, pissed off-looking dude with arms crossed, cold-shriveled
                dick, and fat ass slung over a
                rail post.

            <h4>Sa'issfaction</h4>
            <p>Shortly after the chef's girl broke up with him a beautiful, sultry blonde was hired to seat customers.
              Before long she and the chef were leaving together, and he was again of good cheer.</p>

            <p>As previously written, the Chef was a man at ease with the rich and famous. David Coverdale, lead
              singer of the band "White Snake" lived in the area, was a regular customer and buddy to the chef. And
              at the time Mr. Coverdale was recording an album with legendary Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page - also
              now a restaurant regular and chummy with the chef as well.</p>
            <p>At some point during Page's Tahoe sojourn, he consented to play with a local rock band in the
              establishment's lounge. Though a small venue - 100 person capacity, perhaps - the band erected an
              impressive
              stack of amplifiers, which, upon hopping up to the bar-sized stage, Mr. Page gave instructions to "crank
              'er up."</p>
            <p>Though it literally pained me to do so, I watched the entire hour-or-so-long performance from the right
              edge of the stage, directly in front of the amps, no more than six or seven feet from the rock
              and roll legend, himself. Looking to be in his mid-forties, Mr. Page's physical presence was less than
              impressive. No longer the ripped, axe-slashing super stud in gleaming leather bell bottoms, Page was now
              hunched and scrawny with lots of grey in the yet long rock-n-roll hairdo. And he had a grotesque way of
              contorting his face and thrusting out his aging lips when playing. But his guitar mastery was truly
              impressive. Hence, in spite of the deafening noise I was glad to
              have seen the show.</p>
            <p>After the performance the rock star sat at a table sipping beer with his girlfriend, a brawny,
              long-haired bodyguard, and a few idolizing strangers bold enough to hang with a legend. To his immediate
              right also sat the chef. Suffering from hearing loss that would last three or four days, I sat at the bar
              unobtrusively (I hoped) observing.</p>
            <p>With most of the table's attention focused on the chattering guitarist and chef, there suddenly occurred
              a burst of loud, prolonged laughter from the entire group. A bit far away to comprehend
              the levity, I asked the chef about it when at length he approached the bar for a drink refill. Evidently a
              coven of she-satanists knew Page was in town, were dogging his
              activities, and some were at present in the lounge. Mr. Page, apparently, represented an
              elevated status in their dark belief's hierarchy. The chef then said that upon
              being informed of this the rock legend grinned and in his high-pitched britt-accented voice
              (admirably mimicked by the chef) quipped:</p>
            <p>"Don't really mind who they think I am, really. Long as they gimme sa'issfaction in the bathroom."</p>
            <p>As curious as any fan of the comings and goings of a true legend, I yet declined to wait for
              confirmation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col jay4">
            <p id="center">26</p>
            <h4>Let's Give Him A Hand!</h4>
            <p>Though his wife was now with child, the chef's relationship with the blonde hostess continued, increasing
              in its seriousness. Always a bit heavy, he was now working out, toning up, slimming down and visiting
              tanning booths as well - physical changes that became increasingly noticeable and were likely at the new
              gal's insistence.</p>
            <p>Also changing were his dinner specials. Previously creating pretty much exclusively French, or Italian
              (at times) cuisines, he was more and more working with traditionally Asian foods and flavors. Curries,
              tandoori, peanut sauces, sticky rice and rice noodles, spicy chilies, sesame oil, etc. were being
              substituted for, or combined with the restaurant's usual Mediterranean fare.</p>
            <p>One day I asked why the changes, and he told me:</p>
            <p>"We're going to Taos. Opening up an Asian-Fusion place. Calling it "The Edge." <br />"Really? You
              mean you and the new hottie?" I asked.<br />"Hey! Don't talk about her like that. She can read too, you
              know."<br />"I'm sure she can," I said, surprised by the intensity of his umbrage."And didn't mean to
              imply she couldn't."<br />"Well anyway, yeah, that's what's going on. You wanna come with us?"</p>
            <p>Having already committed to move back to the Northwest, I told him no, I couldn't. And decided it was
              probably best not to ask about his wife and unborn kid.</p>
            <p>Not long after the entire staff was compelled to attend a meeting to be conducted by the financing owner.
              A guy as dopey as he was rich - and he was quite rich - it would no doubt prove to be little more than
              time wasted.</p>
            <p>The meeting time came and my suspicions were confirmed. Phrases like "effectuating positive," "zeroing in
              on the excellence," and "fluid client responsiveness" tumbled forth, sedating all but the usual
              grandstanding sycophants into a groggy stupor.</p>
            <p>Winding it up, his last order of business was to heartily thank the chef for his excellent
              work.<br />"You've done a great job chef....Let's give him a hand!" he concluded, and all obeyed.</p>
            <p>Beaming, the chef raised his fists above his head clasped his hands and pumped them in victory. </p>
            <p>The following day the chef did not show up for work, nor would there ever again. Word then spread that
              during the previous night someone with a key entered and robbed the place blind.</p>

          <div class="col oldman">
            <p id="center">27</p>
            <h4>Old Man </h4>
            <p> The Tahoe restaurant's working owner was a grumpy mid-sixties dude, customarily referred to as "Old
              Man." At least behind his back.</p>
            <p>Personally I had little issues with Old Man, for he seemed to respect my work and generally refrained
              from bothering me. I did, however, have issues with his management of the business funds. More often than
              not, after receiving a paycheck and traveling the 20 or so minute drive to a bank in Tahoe City, the check
              would not clear. Old Man always blamed the bank. Eventually
              I always did get paid but the same could not be said for the non-legal Mexicans working there. Most of
              whom upon learning their labor was not to be compensated, left after only a short period. Old Man was a
              real class act.</p>
            <p>Anyway, one snowy winter day the sous chef, Rick, and I trudged out to an adjacent storage shack to grab
              some needed prep items. Because of the harsh conditions some of the kitchen supplies had been hastily
              dumped in front of the shack, and had yet to be moved inside. While Rick and I collected the needed stuff,
              Old Man, on his way to the restaurant stopped and observed. His grumpy side emerging, he then proceeded
              thus:</p>
            <p><u>Old Man</u> (To Rick): Hey what's going on here?</p>
            <p><u>Rick</u>: What do you mean?</p>
            <p><u>Old Man:</u> What's all this shit doing outside?</p>
            <p><u>Rick:</u> It was delivered this way because of the snow.</p>
            <p><u>Old Man:</u> Well get it inside <em>dumbass.</em> I Pay good money for this shit.</p>
            <p>A good-sized, athletic and somewhat quick-tempered sort, Rick held his tongue as we began digging the
              supplies out of the snow. But I could sense his rage.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to chef "Verg&eacute;'s" disappearance and it was only reasonable to make Rick, who knew
              well the ropes and was a quite competent sous, the restaurant's head chef. Not long after Old Man bumbled
              into the kitchen expressing some unremembered grievance. Old Man apparently did not realize that the
              business's power balance had shifted, and that his practical status was now as irrelevant as Rick's was
              crucial. This Rick knew. He had patiently waited, and the hour of vengeance cometh. No, he didn't
              punch the guy out. But his verbal smack down was both vicious and caused tremendous humiliation. And with
              a concluding salvo on the order of: <b><em>now get the fuck out of my kitchen, <u>Old Man,</u> before I
                  knock your teeth out!,</em></b> Old Man meekly departed.</p>
            <p>My days for the Tahoe restaurant weren't long, but I don't recall Old Man disrupting the kitchen again.

            <h4>Take My Wife - <em>Please</em> 1</h4>
            <p>It wasn't depression, but for quite some time after moving from Beautiful Lake Tahoe to Bellingham,
              Washington, I was not very happy.</p>
            <p>It was late fall when my then wife and I arrived. The town was damp and dreary, grey all the time. Worse,
              a
              hazy chemical stench from the Georgia Pacific paper processing mill eternally mingled with the saline air.
            </p>
            <p>We were both hired on at The Oyster Bar on Chuckanut Drive, a nice hillside place with a view of the
              Northern Puget Sound and San Juan Islands. She to wait tables, I to work in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>The chef was a good, hardworking mild-mannered guy. I liked him from the start. But there were a couple
              of cooks I did not like, nor did they like me. One an army vet who spoke in a serpentine whisper, and
              mumbled a lot. The other a thick, conniving, Canadian loud mouth. The two were pals - a mother and a
              father snake - disrespectful to the chef, and constantly screwing off.</p>
            <p>As much as I liked the ex, and still do, we never should have married. She was - surely still is - a
              bubbly, outgoing, <em>very</em> loquacious type. More or less my opposite. And after the new-love varnish
              rubbed off, we spent more time bickering than any thing else. At times being a moody, sarcastic sort I
              can't say I wasn't part to blame. But I swear I never came across anyone with such tenacity to argue.
              Likely never will.</p>
            <p>But the bickering was generally when she and I were by ourselves. Working together at the restaurant we
              most often got along. The same can't be said regarding my ex and the army vet and his Canadian pal.
              Especially concerning the vet. In that whispery voice of his he was just as eager to quibble and
              contradict as she. At work they were always squabbling. And the restaurant was small. No place to go to
              get out of earshot of their constant back-and-forth. Just plain annoying.</p>
            <p>At some point the Canadian got promoted to the chef position at a new place started by the same owner and
              shortly after got canned when the owner figured out what a dufus he was.</p>

            <div class="AB">
              <p>
                Amuse Bouche
              </p>
              <p id="amb">The Oyster Bar kitchen has an east-facing window with a view of the small, roadside parking
                area. One afternoon just shortly before opening a very nice Mercedes pulled in and a well dressed man
                and woman exited. Knowing the front entrance was still locked I went out and asked the couple if their
                intention was to dine. "What do you think, genius," the gentleman spat, tugging the locked door. "Now
                could you just arrange to have us let in...?" I
                wont detail what shortly followed. But will strongly advise against copping a snotty, superior attitude
                - though
                superior you may be - to the guy about to make your food.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col take2">
            <p id="center">29</p>
            <h4>Take My Wife - <em>Please</em> 2</h4>
            <p>Kind of a funny story about what
              finally happened to make the owner give the guy the boot. Apparently the Canadian guy refused to cook a
              steak well-done for a customer. Said it was against his culinary principles. As luck would have it, the
              customer was the owner's mom. Shazam! No more uppity Canadian chef.</p>
            <p>But at work I still had to deal with the constant quibbling of my ex and the vet. Went on non stop for a
              few solid months. Bugged the crap outta me. Then - and I don't know exactly why - around late
              spring/early-summer their bickering began to subside. Things got a lot more civil. Probably as a
              consequence both me and my ex actually started getting along with the vet, sometimes even doing things
              with him.</p>
            <p>Between me and her, though, things just got worse - the arguments getting longer, hotter, weirder. One
              night at an outdoor party my ex seemed to have even more than her usual belly full of sassafras, and we
              got into something that kept going round and round. When I was finally able to break free I walked over to
              the vet who was grilling salmon on the barbecue. "Take my wife," I said to him. "<em>Please."</em></p>
            <p>And by golly he did! Not sure the of the exact chronology of things but as summer rolled along I kept
              noticing how their mannerisms toward each other got warmer, more intimate-looking. Then at a party at the
              beach one night they sat side-by-side in front of the fire all night long. Just talking, relating.</p>
            <p>Then one day I get phone message where the guy says: "Hey boy...you better watch your
              back...<em>boy,"</em> then hangs up. He was trying to disguise his voice but there was no mistaking that
              whispery, snake-like intonation. It was surely the vet. I guessed that he and the ex must have been a bona
              fide item, and that he was just pissing around his new territory.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the ex wasn't owning up to anything. And in spite of the menacing phone message, when working
              or doing any sort of socializing with the vet, he was always pretty friendly.</p>
            <p>Then things got resolved in a nice, easy way when one evening I saw my ex yakking it up on a pay phone.
              It was mid summer, around 7 so there was still plenty of daylight. No mistaking it was the ex. So she
              comes home later, maybe 11 or so, and I ask where she's been. She tells me at work, which I know is a lie
              because wait shifts at the Oyster Bar start between 4 and 5. Then I tell her that's strange because I saw
              her jabbering on a pay phone around 7.</p>
            <p>Well her eyes then pretty much confessed, and not long after her mouth. Yeah, she was with the vet. They
              were an item. Went on to have a couple of kids and last I saw of them - when they dropped into a
              restaurant I subsequently owned - they seemed a happy family. Though I have to admit I was a little
              curious about that shiner she was wearing.</p>

            <h4>Bennie and Joan</h4>
            <p>One night while line cooking at The Oyster Bar the owner came up to me carrying a plate that had a piece
              of plastic in with the vegetables. It was a new guy doing the vegetables that put them there, but since I
              was the lead cook, no question I was partly to blame. "How'd this get in here," the owner barked. Well I
              didn't really know and was too busy to come up with a clever answer, so I just told him it was an
              oversight, that sometimes shit happens. Not pleased with my response he then got in my face.</p>
            <p>"That's a real jackass answer," he said, visibly irate."I gotta have something more than <em>that</em> to
              tell the customer. Now how'd it get in here!"</p>
            <p>It wasn't the first time he blew up at me, so I got probably more irate than he was and walked out. A
              couple weeks later I was
              hired to
              cook at another eatery on the puget sound, but this one more of a diner-by-the-sea that every
              waterfront area seems to have. And like all those other crappy places, there was a cranky, domineering
              waitress lifer.</p>
            <p>Her name was Joan, but she looked, sounded and acted more like a middle-aged Betty Davis. The
              establishment's uncontested acting lieutenant, Joan - a former Georgian - was pale and gaunt with bleached
              yellow hair and a raspy, wheezy chain-smoking voice. And though brusque and sometimes crotchety Joan was
              also capable of playful banter and took customer service very seriously. Consequently she was well like by
              most of the restaurant's patrons, and was an old friend to lots of the regulars. Concerning her staff
              subordinates - and that was pretty much everyone except the chef and GM - she could, however, be a
              brutally derisive enemy. Competent at my job and coming from an exalted establishment like The Oyster
              Bar, I was never subjected to Joan's derision or wrath - a sure sign of her approval and respect. Not so
              regarding Bennie.</p>
            <p> Shortly after I began Bennie was hired on as a busboy. Acne-faced, bespectacled, plain and pudgy, he was
              a nice kid but somewhat timid and clearly new to the restaurant business. And poor Bennie, or "Bennuh" as
              she called him, was vehemently neither approved of nor respected by Joan.</p>
            <p>"Bennuh!...<em>Bennuh!</em> " became a commonplace refrain upon Joan entering the kitchen - soon followed
              by the inevitable berating:</p>
            <p>"Bennuh how come those ashtrays on table four are full of butts Bennuh? Let me see them glasses of yours
              Bennuh, 'cause if they ain't completely fogged up then you must be able to see, and if you can see maybe
              you're just too dumb to know what a full ashtray looks like."</p>
            <p>"Bennuh! <em>Bennuh!</em> Mr. Anderson on table eight says he asked you for coffee <em>more'n ten
                minutes ago.</em> It's lunchtime, Bennuh, not your lazy-ass break time. Now get that coffee out there!"
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="col bj2">
            <p id="center">31</p>
            <h4>Bennie And Joan 2</h4>



            <p>"Bennuh! <em>Bennuh!</em> I got people waitin' and table twelve's still dirty. I thought you were hired
              to bus tables, Bennuh. Or maybe you think bussing tables is my job, Bennuh. Is that what you think,
              <em>Bennuh?</em> That I'm here to do <em>your</em> job, Bennuh?"</p>
            <p>Now it's true Bennie wasn't a busboy rock star, but his incompetence, at least from my perspective,
              really
              didn't merit the level of Joan's venom. She was just the type that would not hold her peace regarding one
              she didn't like. And she didn't like Bennie. And Bennie being the shy, non-confrontational type that he
              was, only got flustered by the continuous berating, and never said a word of contradiction, nor in his own
              defense.</p>
            <p>Then came a day when a lapse in Bennie's responsibilities was deemed so egregious by Joan that, rather
              than wait until he retreated to the kitchen she verbally pummelled him in front of a full dining room.
              It not being an open kitchen I wasn't able to see the drama, but since it occurred on table the table
              closest to the kitchen - I heard in it's glorious entirety:</p>
            <p>"Get over here Bennuh right now and look at this table! Two water glasses almost empty, an ashtray full
              of butts, and empty plates that have been sittin' here for God knows how long! When are you gonna start
              earning your money Bennuh. When are you gonna start doin' your job! Now take these plates away and change
              that filthy ashtray. And fill up that water pitcher and get back here and fill those glasses, you
              worthless slacker. I tell you now I'm just plain sick of lookin' after you like you was a damn retard. Now
              go you!"</p>
            <p>Entering the kitchen Bennie's face was as red as if he'd been given a physical pummeling as well, and his
              breathing was hard and irregular. Then with a seeming planned purpose he went into the walk-in cooler and
              came out carrying a can of whipped cream. Then he grabbed a styrofoam to-go plate from the counter and
              just as Joan was coming through the swinging kitchen doors squirts a big fluffy
              mound of the cream on it.</p>
            <p>"Bennuh!" <em>"Bennuh!!!" </em></p>
            <p> Then Bennie throws a perfect bullseye.</p>

            <h4>My Car Smells Like Shit</h4>
            <p>
              Where and when is not relevant. But this really did happen. One night during dinner service a waiter,
              Barrie, came up to me and said to check out something going on at one of his tables.
              I peeked into the dining room and at the table in question were three men and one woman. The men
              were engaged in a what appeared to be typical restaurant chit chat. The woman was out cold, her head and
              upper body sprawled upon the table. I watched in awe as the men carried on as though nothing was
              amiss.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few minutes later I was back in the kitchen grabbing a quick dinner when suddenly assailed by a horrible
              smell. I looked up and saw Barrie walking astride another waiter, Joey, each with one hand propping up a
              side of the previously passed out woman, who staggered between. With the other hand the waiters jointly
              held a hotel pan beneath the woman's sagging face as she profusely vomited. Other than assist the
              suffering woman to the
              restroom, little else could be done about terrible profusion that
              expelled from the woman's other end. Why a couple of waiters were tasked with this highly personal and
              disgusting task job was quite, to me, inexplicable. Covering my nose and mouth with a bar
              towel, I looked back into the dining room. The three men were still carrying on as though all was normal.
            </p>
            <p>
              After stabilizing and having cleaned up some, the woman was then escorted out of the restaurant by Joey,
              who was tasked with driving her home as well. Again, quite inexplicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barrie was told, and hence informed me, that the woman had a bad reaction to a couple of hastily
              consumed martinis. And that what had occurred wasn't, for her, particularly unusual. He also
              told me that one of the men at the table was her husband.
            </p>
            <p>
              A short while later Joey returned. Though apparently a promise was made by the husband to have his car
              detailed, he was yet looking none too pleased.
            </p>
            <p>"My car smells like shit."</p>
            <br>

            <div class="AB">
              <p>
                Amuse Bouche
                <p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, shit happens. Even in the best restaurants. One busy night at a fine-dining place I received an
                    order for herb-breaded scallops only to discover that
                    some prep clown blended far too many herbs into the bread. Without time to fix
                    it, I reluctantly sent the dish out with an unappealing blueish green mixture atop the
                    seafood. No complaint was made, however, and upon checking the returned plate I noticed all
                    had been eaten.
                  </p>
            </div>

          <div class="col reign1">
            <p id="center">33</p>
            <div class="AB">
              <br>
              <p> Clearly even though it looked weird, the dish tasted good. Two or three more orders were
                also sent out and evidently happily consumed. After the dinner rush, I grabbed the mixture with the
                intention of adding more bread. Then noticed that the nasty color was not from excessive
                herbs, but rather a frightening quantity of mold.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Purple Reign</h4>
            <p>
              It's not unusual, and even perhaps fitting, for a good chef to have a big ego. And then there are the
              big-headed mediocrities, with inflated egos that suit them like the threadbare jackets and floppy shoes of
              a clown.
              Purple Chef was a fine example of the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before ascending to the Italian restaurant's position of executive chef, Purple Chef was the evening
              sous and liked to style his dark hair with a whimsical infusion of purple. After the head chef moved on,
              Purple Chef was granted the popular Bellingham restaurant's top spot. Shortly thereafter hooking up
              with the general manager, the purple reign thus commenced. Their considerable resources combined, Purple
              Chef was then able to secure a car loan and soon after was in possession of a snappy new purple sedan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purple Chef liked to park his new purple car just outside the restaurant's back entrance, then stride
              through the kitchen while repeating "I'm having a vision...I'm having a vision...." This in regards to his
              profound and mystic culinary divinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              One time during a staff meeting, Purple Chef earnestly related that his ambition for the business was to
              create the finest eating establishment between Vancouver Canada and San Francisco. Not long after, Purple
              Chef and his girlfriend GM, taped paper fishes to the establishment's front window. From then on it was
              the northwest's premier Italian <em>and seafood</em> restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
              In due course, Purple Chef and GM were married. Afterwards there was a party at the restaurant at which
              all staff were invited and asked to pitch in whatever he or she could to help pay for the new couple's
              honeymoon. Purple Chef and bride likely had a combined annual income of $100.000, give or take. The wait
              staff faired moderately well with their tips. Non management kitchen staff each made around $7 per hour.
            </p>
            <p>At some point Purple Chef and GM wife made a TV commercial. Though his GM wife and a few other employees
              were in the commercial, Purple Chef was the undisputed star. Chef hat and jacket be-garbed, Purple Chef
              appeared in several brief scenes elegantly holding a goblet of red wine while
              reciting poetic phrases like "it's about a romance... it's about a symphony of flavors...it's about life
              to be
              savored...." After business hours Purple Chef, his GM wife and other staff would sometimes
              watch the ad over and over.</p>

            <h4>Purple Reign 2</h4>
            <p>
              Because purple chef was the executive chef, and his wife was GM, and his
              wife dominated her subordinates, and he dominated his wife, purple chef quite naturally also dominated her
              subordinates, in addition to his subordinates. And so held a veritable Purple Reign on the business. And
              his ego grew.
            </p>
            <p>
              One night while purple chef relaxed with his GM wife in the restaurant's bar, the establishment suddenly
              filled with people. And with only myself and one other cook, the kitchen labors became overwhelming.
              Fortunately Purple Chef deigned to assist, and after a couple hours of intense food preparation, the
              three of us were through the rush. As Purple Chef prepared to return to the lounge, the other cook joked
              that he (Purple Chef) was free to leave, and that we (the two subordinates) had things under control.</p>
            <p>
              "<b>I saved your butts!</b>" snapped purple chef.
              Odd considering it was Purple Chef's name on the menu. But whatever.</p>
            <p>
              One night Purple Chef, his GM wife and a few other staff (myself included) went to a large wine tasting
              event at a local hotel. Hundreds and hundreds of wines were open and accessible, without charge, to all
              invited. After a time Purple Chef rose and addressed his GM wife.
              "I need to take a leak," he said. <b><em>"Watch my wine!</em></b>"
            </p>
            <p>Among his many notable culinary inspirations, "asian guacamole" was a personal favorite of Purple Chef.
              It was truly a
              clever condiment in which a dash of chopped ginger was added to traditional guacamole. Paired with
              sliced raw tuna, it was offered on the menu as an appetizer. As is customary with raw fish, to keep the
              tuna as fresh as possible, it was
              stored in the freezer and thinly sliced to order.</p>
            <p>One evening during dinner service, purple chef was unable to locate a portion of raw pork
              tenderloin that he had previously placed in the freezer. And was quite distressed to learn that during
              lunch it was thought to be tuna and served, raw, with asian guacamole.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when distressed Purple Chef would sprint upstairs to the private dining room and punch a wall.

            <p>New Year's Eve was consistently one of the restaurant's busiest nights, with all available seating
              invariably taken from opening until after midnight's celebration.</p>
            <p>However the last New Year's during my employment it was not so. Indeed when midnight struck, with the
              exception of the owner's party and the restaurant's staff, the place was empty. It was a curious
              occurrence
              for Bellingham's most venerable Italian fish house. And really without explanation.</p>
            <p>Not too long hence, after having been on the market for a period of time, the restaurant sold. I
              had since
              acquired other employment, but heard from a credible source that though Purple Chef lobbied to continue on
              as executive chef, his efforts failed. And the purple
              reign was no more.</p>

                Sometime after I ran into Purple Chef and the subject of his failed
                interview with the new proprietors came up. Purple
                Chef related that at some point during the interview he was asked if he had any experience with asian
                cuisine. Purple Chef said that upon hearing the question he merely chuckled and shook his head in
                disbelief. Apparently the buffoonish new proprietors had never personally encountered nor even
                heard of Purple Chef's majestic Asian Guacamole.

            <h4><em>Le Cordon Bleu</em></h4>
            <p>After having spent thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands - on a restaurant it is generally considered
              unwise to blow a hard opening.</p>
            <p>At the aforementioned English Brewery restaurant, during the initial week's hard opening it was decided -
              with questionable wisdom - to advertise and then offer a free lunch. The place filled to capacity and
              remained thus even after the under-prepared kitchen descended into chaos and ran out of food. Most patrons
              that day had a bad experience, would likely not return, and dissuade many to even give the place a chance.
              Being the night saut&egrave; cook I missed the excitement, but naturally heard enough of it to tell of the
              event. I can't say with certainty if this opening blunder had a lasting impact on the business. But do
              know
              that, though the place had periods of high volume, in general it was on the slow side. And was, as
              previously noted, sold after only a few years in operation.</p>
            <p>
              Jumping a few years ahead, I was part of the opening of an upscale wood-fire pizza/Italian restaurant
              immediately following my employment under the purple reign.
            </p>
            <p>Having more experience than the majority of the other kitchen hires, my job was to run the more
              complicated pasta station rather than make pizzas. My partner in this position was an Italian fellow,
              "Alberto", whose resume
              included <i>Le Cordon Bleu.</i> Though not yet official, it appeared likely that due to his background and
              his culinary self-confidence, Alberto would become the restaurant's
              chef.</p>
            <p>But as opening day approached I began to notice some extremely dubious culinary techniques employed by
              Alberto, which included the bizarre method of storing cooked pasta <em>in water</em>.
              A method which Alberto put into practice the initial day of the hard opening. And though I strongly argued
              with him against this
              absurd type of food debasement, Alberto insisted it was the best and in water the pasta remained.</p>
            <p>I then voiced my objection to the owners, and to my astonishment was met with similar resistance. Based
              solely on his self-professed and most likely unverified turn at <em>Le Cordon Bleu,</em> they agreed that
              Alberto's ludicrous pasta handling was surely the best. Both owners had some prior
              restaurant experience, so to owner 1, I asked:</p>
            <p>"Have you ever stored cooked pasta in water?"</p>


          </div>
          <div class="col cordBlu2">
            <p id="center">37</p>
            <h4><em>Le Cordon Bleu 2</em></h4>
            <p>"Well no, but <em>I</em> didn't go to <em>Le Cordon Bleu...."</em> My frustration increasing I asked
              owner 2:</p>

            <p>"Have you ever worked someplace at which the chef, or anyone for that matter, stored cooked pasta in
              water?"
            </p>
            <p>"Well no, but I've never worked with a chef, or anyone, who's been through<em> Le Cordon Bleu...."</em>
              Then to both:</p>
            <p>"Have you ever heard of, or seen in a cook book this type of pasta storage?"</p>
            <p>Neither had. But then, neither had engaged in discussions over <em>Le Cordon Bleu</em> pasta handling
              techniques, nor had thumbed through a <em>Le Cordon Bleu</em> cook book.</p>
            <p>My exasperation complete, and indeed sensing a very flawed opening, I had a thought. Grabbing a
              handful of the water-marinated pasta, I commenced to throw it into a saut&egrave; pan and added a
              ladleful
              of puttanesca sauce. After bringing to a simmer, I placed the pasta into bowl. Then requested one of the
              owners
              to sample.</p>
            <p>
              "Hmmm," said owner 1 upon testing, "the pasta's mushy, and the sauce way too watery."
              [<em>Very good.</em>] "Better do it your way."
            </p>
            <p>I was then hastily given the nod to manage the station. Opening was a big success and soon after Alberto
              quietly moved on. I recently looked up the Bellingham wood-fire pizza/Italian restaurant on line. After 20
              years it's still there and seems to be doing well.</p>

                It's possible that Alberto's <em>Le Cordon Bleu </em> education was a lie. The truth I never cared to
                discover. If genuine, I yet would not
                be surprised by his lack of real skills. After Alberto left, a culinary graduate from a local school was
                hired to replace him.
                That he graduated was was quite curious. He had no talent. Curiously enough, he liked to share stories
                detailing how his instructors would proclaim one or another of his food creations "the worst
                ever." I could relate. How it goes in other fields, I wouldn't know. But with regards to formal
                education in food a degree, even from <em>Le Cordon Bleu,</em> often ain't worth jack.

            <h4>Dorked</h4>
            <p>
              "Dick" was from a wealthy California family. He thought it would be a good investment to buy several
              vacant
              buildings in what was still called, but didn't really function as, downtown Bellingham. Apparently it was
              his plan to try and restore the largely defunct part of the city to its former prominence. Among the
              properties he purchased was the three storey, beige-brick and concrete Elks building.
            </p>

            <p>Dick was a talker. One evening he asked to join my ex wife and I as we were finishing dinner at a local
              restaurant. And we talked. Or mostly he did. In a rather brainstorming, stream-of-consciousness
              way.
            </p>
            <p>
              My ex was the front-house manager at a successful brew pub, and intrigued by the idea of ownership. I was
              an experienced line cook,
              still employed at the wood-fire place, and ready for a change. And Dick was interested in an upscale
              restaurant to occupy the main floor
              his Elks building.
              He was
              convinced the three of us would be ideal in the creation of Bellingham's best new restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>It was a simple arrangement. Dick would provide the main floor at a reasonable rental fee, and permit us
              to use the kitchen equipment without additional cost. We would be at liberty to make use of the space as
              we saw fit.
              What we had to work with was a front bar with street-facing windows; a front side room also with
              street-facing windows; a central main-dining area; and kitchen in the back. While my ex and I labored to
              ready the business, Dick would work with the local bureaucracy in securing the necessary permits, and
              bring
              the building to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having had extensive experience working with government, Dick assured us that when we were ready, the
              building would be ready.
            </p>
            <p>
              It took close to a year and a fair bit of credit card-borrowed cash to convert the rather run down bar and
              side space
              (the initial target for opening) into what my ex and I thought an interesting and inviting place for
              social interaction,

                the jockey was hitting it.” -Al Czervik

            <h4>Dorked 2</h4>

            The bar, previously a dingy, insipid off-white shell with overly bright lighting, was now painted in
            tan
            and maroon, with soft canned lighting, solid pine barstools, and small, golden wood tables of my own
            making.
            The side room, previously also a drab vanilla shell, now had a rustic english library theme with
            hardbound-stocked
            bookshelves, wood-simulated wallpaper, a working gas fireplace, a comfy couch, and a beautiful,
            ornately carved upright grand piano.
            Wood-framed prints of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and other great composers decorated the walls, and
            for
            this space I also constructed solid wood tables, though slightly smaller and mahogany toned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interspersed throughout the finished spaces were hidden speakers from which was to be piped soft
              classical
              and baroque music as a mainstay, but with occasional mellow rock and non-blaring jazz as well. The
              establishments chosen name was <em>Arpeggio.</em> The cuisine primarily French and Italian.
            </p>
            <p>As the main area already had the foundation for appropriate ambiance (including dark-hued carpeting,
              marbled-toned pillars and chandelier lighting) the next phase was already being planned. And with only
              a
              few simple additions needed - tables and chairs, a small service bar, and shelving for wine
              bottles, stemware, etc. - we did not foresee much difficulty in its completion. The kitchen and
              bathrooms
              were ready. Indeed to open the business, <em>we</em> were ready.</p>
            <p>
              Dick wasn't ready. Or more accurately, Dick's building wasn't ready. And never would be
              ready. At least for my ex and I. Yeah, we got Dorked. </p>
            <p>
              There was always one complication or other preventing Dick from readying his building to
              the satisfaction of the city. Often lamented by him in his stream-of-consciousness manner, and at
              times also under a heavy influence of pot. We waited and waited but at length needed to move on. At
              some point I had the idea of opening a wine shop, and by way of atonement Dick offered me a few months
              free rent in another of his buildings. One not in need of further bureaucratic
              approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wine shop faired reasonably well. And after a year or so I moved the inventory into a larger,
              nearby
              space - this one not owned by Dick. And with some of the moveable stuff from Arpeggio, my ex and I
              soon
              after opened a restaurant/wine shop business.
            </p>
            <p>
              And not terribly long thereafter, a restaurant in the old Elks building was at long last open.

              I cannot profess to know whether it was to the city of Bellingham, or to Dick himself that Giuseppe made
              the unrefusable "offer". I merely know that at his opening time Dick was still the Elks' owner, and that
              clearly all hoops necessary to jump through had been satisfied. It could have just been a modest payout to
              the right official within Bellingham's bureaucratic maze. A simple remedy I clearly had not considered.

            <p>Of all the fine people whom I have had the pleasure of working with, among my
              favorites was Knute.</p>
            <p>
              Knute was one of the line cooks working at the previously noted Italian restaurant when there I began
              employment.
            </p>
            <P>Mid-twenties and a guitarist in a local metal band, Knute admirably copped the requisite
              rebellious
              attitude of a hard rocker, and with shoulder-length straight blond hair, looked the part as well. But
              beneath the bad boy veneer was a young man of substantial charm and likability, in addition to being a
              solid and conscientious laborer.</P>
            <p>
              Knute's girlfriend at the time, "Linda", was the restaurant's principle hostess. Blonde as well, Linda
              was
              soft-spoken, slender, attractive and overtly sweet natured. And though very youthful for her age, Linda
              was clearly a fair bit older - perhaps by a decade or more - than Knute. But regardless of age
              discrepancy
              they seemed compatible and happy with each other. And sufficiently committed to the relationship to live
              together, which they did at Linda's house in the rural outskirts of Bellingham.

                  Good bread is not hard to make and well worth the time. I've learned to make very nice Sourdough,
                  French, Focaccia and baguette from free youtube videos. Whether you make or buy good bread, it's
                  good to have a Panini grill on hand. When the bread gets a bit stale pop in the fridge. When ready to
                  eat, slice, brush on olive oil or butter, then press into the grill. Cook until warm and soft, or
                  toasty and crunchy. It'll be delish. And as long as the bread is properly sealed in plastic, it's good
                  for weeks.

              After a few months working with Knute, it became increasingly apparent that his sweet, pretty girl had
              considerably more interest in me than the guy with whom she was currently living. Perhaps thinking I had
              designs on her as
              well, or maybe out of a more general displeasure with the unraveling of his love life, Knute, towards
              myself, became increasingly unfriendly. This saddened me. As stated, I really liked Knute. And
              beyond a typical male appreciation for an attractive gal, in Linda I had no interest. And if I had,
              knowing full well Knute's abiding affection for her, I would not have acted on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After work one Fourth of July night, a bunch of the restaurant's staff gathered on a nearby rooftop to
              watch the fireworks over Bellingham Bay. I was sitting apart from the group and watching the show, when
              suddenly Linda sat beside me and placed her head on my shoulder. I knew Knute was in visible proximity and
              watching. I can't deny the thrill of feeling a beautiful female face so close to mine, but even stronger
              was the empathetic humiliation I felt for Knute. I scooted over enough to disengage contact, as Knute
              approached and sat on the other side of Linda. Thus we remained, in silence, until the fireworks ended.
            </p>
            <p>At a party following, Linda continued to openly ply me with her considerable charms, well knowing the
              unsettling effect it was having on Knute.</p>
            <p>But between Linda and I nothing of a romantic nature ever transpired. And as it turned out another line
              cook was hired who soon after became the object of Linda's amorous attention, and subsequent house mate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometime after, at a bar with some co-workers, I was eves-dropping on a conversation between Linda and a
              waitress. At one point during the exchange Linda was asked how she felt about dumping Knute, and hooking
              up with the new beau.
            </p>
            <p>"Well things are going pretty good," chuckled Linda. "You know, it's all part of the catch and release
              program."</p>
            <h4>***</h4>
            <p>
              In time - and in addition to an already operational wine shop ("The Vines")- my ex and I were the
              overstressed
              owners of a downtown Bellingham restaurant, Du Jour Bistro.
              I very much liked the wine business, so after getting the restaurant open and running,
              It was my intention to bring on a chef to take charge of the kitchen.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col catch3">
            <p id="center">43</p>
            <h4>Catch and Release 3</h4>


            <p>
              One night Linda came with yet another catch. Upon
              dining, the new catch was impressed. And having heard of the available chef job, afterwards hustled back
              to the open kitchen to meet me, convey his enthusiastic compliments, and offer to fill the position. He
              turned out to have talent, and was hired.
            </p>

            <p>
              The chef ultimately didn't work out, and wasn't for long. But one thing I found quite interesting about
              him was his frequently rude, in a passive way, treatment of Linda. I first observed this one night after
              closing, when he sat with my visiting sister, my ex, and I for at least an hour, while Linda sat alone and
              uncomfortable across the room.
              And on several occasions after, he did likewise with other friends or acquaintances.
              He seemed to take genuine pleasure in making his girl look and feel awkward.
              (I say girl but at this time in Linda's life it was obvious her forever-young catches were now at an age
              discrepancy sufficient to be her offspring, as indeed the new bistro chef was).
            </p>
            <p>
              But as stated, the young chef's tenure was not to last, and after a few months he moved on. And I was
              again doing hard labor in an increasingly busy kitchen. Oh well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business lasted about ten years, with the initial half marked by success, followed by a frustrating
              period of setbacks and decline. Eventually circumstances necessitated closing the business and selling all
              inventory. And I then began preparations to move to South America.</p>
            <p>Throughout the intervening years of business ownership, it wasn't uncommon for me to cross paths and
              briefly visit with Knute. The long hair and hard rock attitude evolved into a short crop, trimmed beard
              and mustache, and an affable maturity suggestive of a guy enjoying a fun, successful life. Which, as the
              owner of a popular Paella catering company, he evidently was.
              And though the initial encounters were somewhat strained, in time any antipathy for past events was
              forgotten or left behind..
            </p>
            <p>A short while before my departure South, I ran into Linda outside the local food Co-op. It was a sunny
              spring afternoon and as we neared I noticed that, though still with some waning attributes of youth and
              beauty - the styled, blonde-colored hair; the slender (though slightly bent) figure; the overtly sweet
              demeanor - her face had become old. And her eyes bespoke the sadness of a woman whose halcyon days of
              catch and release were over.

            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves</h4>

            <p>Mr. Bigs was the de facto patron saint of hospitality in Bellingham.
              A towering, tremendously successful businessman, he was regularly seen in one local eatery or another at
              which he invariably spent freely and tipped well. And, thankfully, this did include Du Jour Bistro.
              I liked Mr. Bigs. Though filthy rich and treated as royality, in addition to his generosity, he was always
              polite and respectful. And as with many of the local ownership, Mr Bigs was on friendly terms with my ex
              and I.
            </p>
            <p>
              One night around closing time, Mr. Bigs popped in with a lady friend and joined myself and ex., and a few
              bistro staff, for a bottle of wine. He and his friend "Jenny" had just been to a recently opened
              restaurant and were quite enthusiastic over the experience. Just north of the Canadian border in the small
              seaside town of White Rock, the restaurant was an upscale, white tablecloth sort called <em>Pearl.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Amid their enthusiastic recounting, Jenny then suggested a return visit in which all currently seated go
              together. Readily agreeing to the suggestion Mr. Bigs then said it would be his treat, and extended the
              invitation to include present company spouses as well.
            </p>

              <img src="img/champ1.png" id="champ" alt="">
              <p> Corked wine has nothing to do with the physical integrity of the cork. It is a chemical contamination
                usually occurring in the cork itself, or sometimes in a part of the winery at which the wine was made. A
                small amount of cork taint results in a wine with muted flavors and aromas. A larger amount in a
                disgusting, mildewy smell and taste. It is estimated somewhere between 3 and 5 percent of wines using
                traditional corks (made from tree bark) have some degree of cork taint. Cork taint does not
                discriminate. It can ruin that 8 buck Trader Joes Merlot, or $1000 Bordeaux you've been cellaring for a
                decade.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The group was 8. I brought along a case of wine to sample with the food. Mr. Bigs had a large vehicle with
              chauffeur, so getting trashed wasn't an issue.
              It was summer when we arrived, and the sun was shining in the beautiful resort town.

            <p id="center">45</p>
            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 2</h4>
            <p>Upon entering, the host espied the case of wine I was carrying, and offered to take it for safe keeping.
              I gave him the box and as he shuffled away I asked to please begin chilling the two bottles of Chablis
              that were within. Mr. Bigs was greeted enthusiastically by all. Of course they remembered him. His
              generosity never failed to impress.</p>
            <p>
              We were seated at a white-clothed table laden with polished settings and fine, German stemware. Mr. Bigs
              sat on
              one end flanked by my ex and Jenny. I sat on the other next to the Bistro's sous chef and his wife. In the
              center were two bistro servers.
              A bus boy came to fill water goblets, and I reiterated my request to have the Chablis chilled, and that we
              intended to have it with a round of oysters. He promised to check on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A server came inquiring about beverage starters. I told him of the Chablis I brought, and asked him to
              please get it on ice and bring it to the table.
              He said he'd check on it. I ordered the oysters.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Would you like caviar as well?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinking caviar would also be nice with the Chablis I agreed. The waiter nodded and shuffled off. Out of
              curiosity I flipped open the menu to check out what kind of caviar they had. It was Beluga. And
              <em>very</em> expensive.
            </p>
            <p>After a few minutes the server returned and announce a corkage policy of $25 per opened bottle. It was a
              bit steep, but I told him that would be fine.
              Another staff member then approached and told me that in addition to the $25 corkage fee, for each bottle
              of
              wine opened it was also necessary to buy a bottle from the house.<p>
                "You must be kidding," I said.</p>
              <p>
                "I'm not," he said.</p>
              <p>
                "Can I see the manager?" I asked.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm the manager," he answered. "And the sommelier."
              </p>
              <p>
                I got up and approached Mr. Bigs, who was talking animatedly with the two flanking girls. I told him the
                corkage fee was a bit exorbitant. He said
                not to worry about it, and to just get some wine to the table.
              </p>

            <p>
              The oysters and caviar arrived. I jumped up and hustled over to the host.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Could you <em>please</em> have someone send over the Chablis on ice?"
            </p>
            <p>"Let me check on that, he said."</p>
            <p>
              A couple minutes later the Sommelier arrived with the 2 bottles of Chablis in a bucket of ice.
            </p>
            <p>"How about a couple bottles of Krug Champagne?" He inquired, opening the Chablis.</p>
            <p>
              I grabbed the wine list and scanned the champagnes. The Krug was $700.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I don't think so," I said, flipping to the Canadian white wine section. "Bring me 2 bottles of the
              Mission
              Hill Pinot Gris."
            </p>
            <p>
              "The Krug will be better with the oysters," he said, visibly offended by my selection.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I think the Gris will be fine," I countered.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The Krug will be <em>much</em> better with the oysters," he insisted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chablis had still not been poured, and the ice beneath the plated oysters was melting. I suspected Mr.
              Bigs was getting impatient.
            </p>
            <p>"Could you please pour the Chablis," I said, nodding in the direction of Mr. Bigs. "And then bring the
              Gris."</p>
            <p>
              At last relenting on the Krug sale, the Sommelier slithered over to Mr. Bigs and began pouring the wine.
            </p>
            <p>The oysters and caviar were nice, and paired wonderfully with the Chablis. In short order the Sommelier
              arrived with the Pinot Gris.</p>
            <p>"Would you care for a round of <em>Foie Gras?"</em></p>
            <P>"I don't think so," I said. "There are a couple bottles of Cristom Pinot in the case I brought that I'd
              like opened. And please send the waiter to take our orders."</P>
            <p>"Got it. So was that a yes on the <em>Foie Gras</em>?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col bigs4">
            <p id="center">47</p>
            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 4</h4>
            <p>
              <p>"King crab with truffle butter?"</p>
              <p>
                "No thanks."
              </p>
              <p>"It's very nice...."</p>
              <p>"I'm sure, but I think everyone is ready to order. And please don't forget the Cristom."</p>
              <p>
                The Sommelier left and shortly after arrived the waiter. As it was with the Sommelier, with
                <em>everything</em> ordered came an aggressive suggestion, and sometimes insistance, of an expensive
                accompaniment. Already inured to the sleazy tactics, I refused every enticement, and simply ordered a
                salad and entree. But most of the others played into the game and acquiesced to a topping of shaved
                truffles, slice of lobster <em>pat&egrave;</em>, Kobe tenderloin slider, etc. The bill would no doubt be
                impressive.
              </p>
              <p>The Sommelier then showed up with the pinot, both bottles already opened and one minus a generous
                sampling.</p>
              <p>"How's the Cristom," I asked.</p>
              <p>"Nice. And by the way, the corkage policy has changed. It's $35 plus two from the house."</p>
              <p>It was blatant thievery.</p>
              <p>
                "And if you'd like another pinot, I would recommend the La Romanee;"
              </p>
              <p>"Of course you would. Look man, this is...seriously unethical...I'm in the business...have never seen
                anything like it...."</p>
              <p>"What do you care, <em>you're</em> not paying."</p>
              <p>"So the guy's rich. That doesn't give you license to blatantly rip him off."</p>
              <p>
                "Sure it does."
              </p>
              <p>I looked over to Mr. Bigs. Now with a two-glass buzz he was gregarious, animated and happy. I felt
                certain he
                would would have resented - even been insulted - were I to again interrupt over a cost concern. But I
                sure as hell wasn't going to agree to La Romanee at $2400 a pop.</p>

                One day at the wine store a woman entered and approached me at the front desk. The previous night she
                had been to a wine-tasting event. The South African Cabernet she brought, which I had recommended
                and sold to her, was crap. "Smelled and tasted like old rot." All agreed it was bad - by far the worst
                of the night. She was embarrassed
                and humiliated. I knew the wine, knew it was, normally, a good wine; and said that she had unfortunately
                received a corked bottle. She insisted there was nothing wrong with the cork. I explained (as above)
                that it wasn't <em>the</em> cork, but something <em>in</em> the cork. A contamination <em>of</em> the
                cork. It didn't sink in. I asked her to bring in the bad bottle for a replacement. She said she was so
                disgusted she poured it out and threw the bottle away. No, she didn't save the receipt. She just wanted
                to know how I could recommend such a <em>bad</em> wine. She never returned.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              I snatched the wine list and ordered an assortment of Okanagan reds - some of the lesser expensive on the
              list. The Sommelier smirked, said margin was highest on the Canuck juice, and disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>A short while later the table was teeming with bottles, stemware, and food laden plates of all sizes.
              When the entrees and sides were consumed Mr. Bigs called for a dessert menu, and I was tasked with an
              accompanying beverage.</p>
            <p>Not caring much for sweets, I got the attention of the Sommelier, and asked that he bring one of the two
              bottles of a nice Chateauneuf Du Pape from my case. A couple of glasses of which, for me, would be a more
              agreable conclusion. And for the two required house wines I requested an off dry Prosecco.</p>
            <p>"Well we have a decent Prosecco, but the <em>Sauterne</em>, now that's to die for."</p>
            <p>"Just bring the Prosecco, please."</p>
            <p>"You just don't get it," he said, smiling, but with more than a little contempt.</p>

            <h4>Mr. Bigs, Pearl and A Den of Thieves 6</h4>
            <p>
              So we ate, drank, laughed and slurred through the meal's termination. Upon his delivery of the dessert
              wines, I asked the Sommelier to return to me the case that was so curiously absconded with upon arrival.
              He nodded.
            </p>
            <p>When the bill was delivered I made a point to observe. Mr. Bigs merely glanced at it, then appeared to
              fill in the tip section and scribble his signature. His look of relaxed enjoyment not altering in the
              least.</p>
            <p>
              Of course the Sommelier did not return to me the case. And before exiting of course I had to insist to the
              host to get it. He did, and after being handed the top-folded box, I joined the group outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              When back home it occurred to me to open the case and check. And indeed, of the 7 full bottles that should
              have remained, there were only 4, along with some empties. Among the missing were some pretty good wines,
              including the second Chateauneuf Du Pape - a considerably more costly bottle. I wasn't really surprised.

                An amiable Italian named Nardoni would occasionally come in to the bistro to sell
                his wine and sometimes have a meal. One night he came in with his wife and announced they both wanted
                "Pasta con ajo y olio... Can ya make us a-some? It's just-a pasta with garlic and-a olive oil. I can
                write you a recipe...." Of course I could, and did make the pasta. They were both visibly pleased.
                Afterwards he thanked me and handed me a slip of paper. It read: <u>PASTA CON AJO Y OLIO.</u> PASTA,
                GARLIC, OLIVE OIL. MAYBE SOME A-RED CHILI PEPPER.

              The following scan insertions are of a newsletter I wrote (one of several) detailing occurrances, factual
              or otherwise, at Du Jour Bisto. This one focuses on the bistro's generous policy of selling bottled wine
              to restaurant patrons at retail plus 5 dollars, and how the policy was considered by some a deceitful way
              to jack up the bill. It also reveals the then full time staff members, along with relevant, um, abilities.

              Another writing venture I undertook when in Bellingham was a multi-drama play that my ex and I planned to
              stage at the bistro, but never ultimately organized. Interspersed with the stories were a day's worth of
              short wine shop interactions that, in most cases, are based in truth. I must admit, however, to the
              merchant being perhaps a touch fictionalized.

              <p><u>Cust:</u> Oh, no. I was there last fall and had this really good wine. It was made there in Iowa.
              </p>
              <p><u>Merch</u>: Really? Interesting. And just what type of wine was it?</p>
              <p><u>Cust:</u> Iowan. It was called Iowine.</p>

                  some more it'll be on hand. Now, if you'd like me to recommend something other than Iowine...?</p>
                <p><u>Cust:</u> No thanks. But I appreciate the great advice. And the next time in Iowa, I'm going to

                  Canyon, Leonetti, Dunham, Pepper Bridge, most of The Longshadow wines. I even talked my way into
                  Cayuse - of course I've been on their mailing list for years.</p>

                  A good friend and customer invited me to his house for dinner, shortly before my departure to South
                  America. Also invited was a neighbor of his, a woman who was a semi-regular wine customer of mine as
                  well. She brought with her a bottle of Leonetti Cabernet, one of the most coveted Washington wines at
                  the time. She poured me a glass which was, to me, noticably corked. When she saw that I wasn't
                  drinking it she asked why. I explained that it was corked, an off bottle, and that it was just an
                  unfortunate part of the wine business. She didn't understand and as the night wore on seemed
                  increasingly offended. I suspected were I to have continued on with the B'ham wine store, she would no
                  longer have been a customer.

              <p><u>Merch:</u> Hmmm. Was it floral, like a gewurtztraminer? On the sweet side? Rich and buttery like a
                big chardonnay?</p>
              <p><u>1st Woman:</u> Well, it was kind of sweet, but dry. And very smooth.</p>

                pink. And tastes sorta like cotton candy, but better.</p>
              <p><u>Merch:</u> I was kidding. Of course I've heard of it. Haven't had the displeasure in years. But,

                level of <em>cotton candy,</em> but.... Now take this one from Provence, a Bandol made from a blend of
                Grenache and Mourvedre. Just look at that beautiful salmon color. It is at once round, full, fruity,
                light, dry and refreshing. Give it a chill and it will pair with just about anything: Burgers, grilled
                vegetables, Indian food, Chinese, fish, sausages, barbecue, sandwiches. At $24 a bottle it is admittedly
                not
                cheap, but if you wish to spend less, check out this Spanish pink. Made from 100% tempranillo, a
                principal red grape of Spain, it is deeper in color than the Bandol, and a bit fatter and less refined
                on the palate. But still fresh, and delicious and not at all cloying. And will pair as well with
                a wide variety of food. And this gem is only $7.99, not much more than your white zin, right?</p>
              <p><u>Cust:</u> That's all great, but I really just want the Butter Hill.</p>

              <p><u>1st Girl:</u> Never heard of that. Anyway, my sister's 30th birthday's coming up and I want to get
                her something nice. She's actually taken classes on wine appreciation, and likes the good stuff,
                especially champagne.</p>
              <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> Yeah? Have you ever had a champagne cooler?</p>
              <p><u>1st Girl:</u> No. But I like wine coolers. Let's see...champagnes....here they are. I want to get
                her a real nice one. One that'll blow her mind.</p>
              <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> How about this one... how do you even say that? "Voov Clickot?" That's almost $60! Who
                would spend that much on one bottle of wine? And look at some of these others, they're even more!</p>
              <p><u>1st Girl:</u> My sister spends that much all the time, at least ever since she got that tech job.
                But I want to get her something <em>really</em> good.</p>
              <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> Hey look over there, that's the wine I had at Jordan's. Yellow Tail. That's right.
                With the kangaroo. And here's a note about it. (Reads) <b><em>"I personally do <u>not</u> care for this
                    wine, which tastes of cooked fruit, cheap vinification and saccharine. But since I get so many
                    requests, I brought some in. Enjoy!"</b></em> Weird. Well I like it. Why don't you get her a bottle
                of this?</p>
              <p><u>1st Girl:</u> Nope, it's gonna be champagne. And I've got a hundred bucks to spend on it.</p>
              <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> You're crazy.</p>

                dealing with your types all day. All sold out.</p>

                suggest going to a swill peddler. Try Cheapies Beverage downtown.</p>
              <p><u>1st Girl:</u> Do they sell champagne there?</p>

                up.</p>
              <p><u>2nd Girl:</u> I don't think this gentleman wants your business, Tiffany.</p>

                most of these Rhones here that I just mentioned are 100% organic, using only the best
                pesticide-and-herbicide-free farming methods for years - decades!</p>

                Here are two from Oregon, a pinot noir and gris. Each $15 a bottle. Here's a $12 organic zin from
                California. Over here I have a nice certified organic riesling from Yakima...that is...well there you

            <p>
              <b>Cheryl</b>
            </p>
            <p>After a few years running the kitchen and wine shop, business had grown enough to merit hiring a couple
              of competant chefs, and for me to pursue my passion for wine. Having cellared a sizeable amount of wines
              destined to increase in value and savory intrigue with time, I decided to open a higher end wine
              store in another location.</p>
            <p> As it turned out the decision was not a good one. Within a year, the restaurant's reputation and
              regular clientel had woefully diminished, and out of necessity, I broke the lease on the new space, and
              moved back into the old.
              <p>
                Many of the details of the above time period, and what transpired up to the business's closing, I have
                written in a mostly non-fictional work titled "The Lot", and so will not repeat here. Only to say that
                after returning, it became painfully evident that the bustling days and nights of Du Jour Bistro/The
                Vines Wineshop were fork-tender done.
              </p>

              <p>
                At some point during this period of decline, I hired a server named Cheryl. Cherly was friendly,
                energetic, smart and a drop dead looker. Dark, glossy black hair, large blue-grey eyes and a
                centerfold's body, I suspected that Cheryl could
                very possibly generate a dedicated group of admiring male clientel. As it turned out, however, her
                tenure was not
                sufficient to build a following.
              </p>
              <p>
                A short time into her employ, Cheryl introduced me to her boyfriend, Alex, and asked if he could work at
                the Bistro as well. Good-looking and charismatic (Cheryl and Alex were both acting students at
                Western Washington U.) I agreed.
              </p>
              <p>
                As time passed it became increasingly clear that along with her many positive traits, Cheryl also had
                issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                One night after business hours I sat sipping wine with Cheryl and an old restaurant workhorse named
                Bill. I'd worked with Bill in previous places, and when it came time to open the bistro, brought him on.
                He busted his ass, did a lot of the dirty work, and rarely complained. A truly invaluable asset.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cheryl was distracted and moody, and after a few sips spoke of her distress.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Alex is at a party in Seattle. Too late for me to go," she huffed. "I just bet he's having fun, and
                that
                there's lots of girls there."
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col dumz">
            <p id="center">67</p>
            <h4>Du Jour Denoument: 3 Short Dumz 2</h4>

            <p>
              Sympathetic to her youthful plight, Bill and I did our best to cheer her up, telling her that, hey, it
              can't be that bad. At least your here with us, surely drinking much better than whatever crap Alex is
              stuck with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not really hearing us, Cheryl's phone rang and she jumped up and left the room. For a few moments we
              heard distant, yet animated - and clearly unhappy - ranting from Cheryl. Upon returning her eyes
              were glazed from internal agitation, and her face ashen and contorted.
            </p>
            <p>
              "He said things aren't going that great, but I just <i>know</i> he's having fun. I think he was trying to
              muffle the noise but I could still hear the party going on. <i>Tons</i> of girls."
              <p>She was blankly staring ahead and chewing a curled finger.</p>
              <p>"And here I am stuck with <i>you and Bill."</i></p>
              <p>
                Yes, she really said that. And just <i>like</i> that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finishing her wine, Cheryl left.
              </p>
              <p>Cheryl's issues continued to surface. Then one night we got into a heated argument, and I fired her.
              </p>
              <p>A short time after, Alex came to the bistro to get Cheryl's last check. He inststed that she was great
                for
                both me and the restaurant and was pissed that she got canned.</p>
              <p>"And I assume that means I'm out too," he said.</p>
              <p>"Why would you think that," I answered. I have no problem with you. You're welcome to stay on."</p>
              <p>He was both taken aback and visibly pleased. </p>
              <p>"Oh! Hmm. Well...I guess I shoud talk to Cheryl about that."</p>
              <p>He did not return. Whether this had to do with Cheryl I don't know. I did learn from a niece of mine -
                a
                fellow WWU acting student who was at the notorious Seattle party - that things indeed
                did not go well for Alex, who spent the entire time in a bedroom alone with
                a stomach ache. My niece also informend me that not too long after Cheryl's termination at the Bistro,
                Alex dumped her.</p>

              <b>Angie's Guy</b>
              <p>
                For a few years Angie had been stopping by the Bistro to tell me about, or have me taste, a current
                group
                of wines she was selling. She was a pleasant and lovely 40ish blonde whose wine passion rivalled my own.
                She had spoke often of her desire to get out of sales, and open a store like The Vines. One day it
                occurred to me that once the restaurant sold (which was on the
                market) it could work out to bring her on to help in the wine store. Given her looks, temperement and
                passion for the business, I thought she would
                make an ideal future co-owner.
              </p>
              <p>I sent her an email informing her of this, and inquired whether she would have an interest in talking
                it over. She quickly responded and assured me that, yes, she was very interested. And we set a time to
                meet.</p>
              <p>
                A few days later at the appointed time, Angie arrived at the Bistro. Angie, along with her guy. Telling
                me her guy would likely be part of the package of bringing her on, she then said that he would surely be
                an asset, and insisted that he was quite intelligent and "good with spreadsheets".
              </p>
              <p>
                Angie's guy was (naturally, given his gal's attributes) marlboro-man handsome, tall and confident. And
                though not very happy with the sudden twist to my idea, I did not object to have him included,
                and the three of us sat down to talk.
              </p>
              <p>
                An hour or so into the meeting, Angie excused herself to go to the restroom. And after bumbling through
                some awkward (for me) getting-to-know-you chat, Angie's guy smiled confidently, looked me in the eye,
                and commenced thus:
              </p>
              <p>"So listen, I was wondering how you would feel about Angie and I taking over the business."</p>
              <p>"What...?</p>
              <p>"You know, assuming all goes well, what do you think about the possibility of us buying you out...."
              </p>
              <p>I don't remember how, or even if, I responded. I do remember thinking that this consummate dunce just
                mouth-blundered his gal out of a potentially stellar opportunity.
                Angie returned. We finished the meeting and they left.</p>
              <p>
                The following day Angie called. I told her about her guy's rather blunt and unexpected proposal. She
                sighed, said he told her, and apologized. She knew the deal was off. I've not seen her since. And can
                only speculate over the dubious fate of Angie and her guy.

            <p>
              <b>DingDong Dipshitz</b>
              <p>Ding and Dong (a married couple whom I shall hence collectively refer to as "DingDong") came to the
                Bistro for the second time after the selling price had dropped to 35k. At that price -
                which included everything except the wine inventory, they were definitely interested. They hung around a
                while making measurements and visualizing their food service concept for the space. Before they left I
                gave them the landlord's number and a couple days later I checked with the landlords (also a married
                couple) to find out if they had heard from DingDong. They had, and already scheduled a meeting to work
                out the lease terms. Though the low selling price irked me, I was pleased with the sale's timing, as I
                had a South American trip planned that was to commence in a few days, and upon returning could settle
                all the restaurant's affairs. And then plan, unencumbered, a return journey to my new life in Colombia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trip went well, and I was very happy with my beautiful new Colombian girlfriend. But things back in
                the states had taken a decidedly nasty turn - for me, anyway. At the meeting with the landlords,
                DingDong expressed their interest in renting the space, but had no interest in buying the existing
                business inventory. And, incredibly, the landlords gave them the OK. Thus after shelling out 10 year's
                rent I
                was brusquely told by
                the landlords to vacate within a couple of months. And of course rather than receive cash for my
                considerable
                business equipment, I had to liquidate.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so, with no alternative option (though rest assured I did vehemently argue the situation's lunacy) I
                liquidated. Everything. From the two dining areas I sold all tables, chairs, shelving, display cases,
                decorations, glass and stemware; music, computer and phone equipment; food and wine accessories and wine
                racks; and a large, solid-wood front desk. As well as a whole bunch of accumulated nick-nacks and
                bric-a-brac.
                From the kitchen I sold off all ovens and ranges; all refridgeration; a professional dishwashing station
                with
                all
                plumbing; all prep tables, mixers, blenders, kitchen knives and smaller stuff. Among the last of
                things to be torn down and pedeled off was an 8 by 3 foot stainless steel hood with filters, ducting,
                fire
                suppression and exhaust fans. And
                all was gone within the 2 month timeline.

                Shortly after one of the landlords
                (the
                wife)
                came in to the space, looked around, audibly gasped, and blurted out: "The dishwasher too!"

                well-dressed 40ish man of apparent Indian heritage. And though he did not inform me of whatever
                intentions he
                may have had with the space, I conjectured that perhaps he was considering an Indian restaurant. While
                he
                approached his eyes scanned the disorder, and then focused on the large heap of stainless steel hood
                components that just a day prior had been installed, intact and ready for use. He looked to me and asked
                what
                was up. I told him new tenants had been procured, and that I was ordered out. He shook his head and
                smiled
                sadly. And without disclosing his reason for coming, he left.</p>

            <p>
              Inspiration and luck are good and necessary. But regarding the risk and potential success of a new
              business
              venture, especially in a foreign country, due diligence is key.
            </p>
            <p>
              While strolling through the mid-sized Colombian town of Sabaneta, in the department of Antioquia my
              girlfriend,
              Julieta, and I chanced into a local bar that was owned by an American. After a few minutes chatting with
              the
              guy, I told him of my desire to open a restaurant space somewhere in the area. By coincidence (or luck?),
              he
              informed me one was for sale just a few blocks down the street.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a corner space of about 40 square meters, situated in a busy middle-class residential area, with
              both
              indoor and outdoor seating and a modestly equipped kitchen. The current food offerings were <i>comida
                typica</i>
              which generally entailed inexpensive plates with a selection of thin slabs of meat, rice, beans,
              <em>chicharron</em> (pork belly), squashed plantains (<em>patacones</em>), chorizo, avocado slices, green
              salad
              and a couple basic soup offerings. Having no intention of serving the usual Colombian eats, the menu was
              of no
              importance.</p>
            <p> What mainly interested me was the cost of acquiring the space and basic but usable equipment and
              furnishings.
              And after discussing the matter a couple of hours, an amount of around 8 thousand dollars was agreed upon
              (in
              equivalent pesos, of course), which I thought to be quite a bargain. And since further inquiry into rent,
              utilities, etc. also proved quite doable, I was indeed <em>inspired</em> - with Julieta's encouragement -
              to
              plunge into another food endeavor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the ridiculously complicated process of starting a restaurant in the U.S., getting one going in
              Colombia
              is free of meddelsome governmental hinderences, hence a very simple process. And thus, after only a month
              or so
              - and with a few improvement-tweaks here and there - the place was ready for business.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new restaurant was called <em>La Esquina Mediterranea</em> (The Mediterranean Corner), and the menu
              (of
              course) was primarily French and Italian with a splash of Spanish and Greek.

            </p>
            <p>
              The menu included Beef Bourguignon, Chicken Provencal, 2 Lasagnas, a few pastas, Souvlaki, etc. Nothing
              particularly imaginitive, but good, solid dishes that were very well received by what would become our
              regular
              clientel. And the prices, averaging around $6 U.S., were extremely cheap - at least compared to U.S.
              restaurant
              prices.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the place never really took hold. And as dedicated as were the regulars, the amount remained
              stubbornly
              insufficient. It was a charming, inviting bistro that I was certain would have done quite well in a
              comparative
              setting in the States. And I personally never tired of sitting outside on a warm Antioquian night, or
              inside
              when the strong rains pounded the building, munching on a crispy thin pizza or a gorgeously tender plate
              of
              braised beef; while chatting with my adopted family or a new acquaintance, and of course drinking too much
              wine.
              But even after a couple years the business was inconsistent, barely paying for itself and our modest
              personal
              expenses, never to make us any real money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time I became frustrated. Then one afternoon I was expressing my frustration to a Spanish friend who
              had a
              neighboring retail business, and he offered up an explanation. He told me that Colombians generally don't
              go to
              isolated places in residential areas to eat. They prefer to congregate. Malls, crowded grocery store
              complexes,
              lively central business areas. Exactly the sort of places that I tended to avoid when thinking of dining
              options. I had been to enough of these busy areas to know this, but didn't consider it when hastily
              deciding to
              acquire the restaurant. It was a huge part of Colombian dining cultural that I failed to consider.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to put the restaurant up for sale, have Julieta (now wife) and her talented son Juan run the
              place,
              and move back to the States.

            <h4>Six Jobs</h4>
            </p>
            <p><b>1st</b></p>
            <p>
              Before heading back to the states, I managed to secure a job via Craigslist, at a restaurant in Issaquah
              Washington. I was to be staying at a sister's downstairs apartment in Kirkland, so there would be a bit of
              a
              commute, and the pay was frankly quite low for the area. But I wanted to gain some independence as quickly
              as
              possible, so I accepted the job's obvious cons, and got started shortly after returning.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a small place with a seating capacity of only about twenty, owned by a fortyish Indian woman,
              "Etta" and
              her septuagenarian American husband. The couple agreed to pay me for 3 days under the table, upon the
              conclusion
              of which my future employment would be discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though small the place was busy, doing two full turns each of my first 3 nights. The food was very good,
              an
              interesting fusion of French and Indian, with an emphasis on braising. Etta was both the menu's creator
              and
              principle server, and a young, enegetic head cook prepared the food admirably; although in a manner, I
              thought,
              needlessly intense and stressful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with assisting the cook, my job also was to help Etta by bussing tables, filling water glasses,
              etc.,
              which I discovered to my dismay was a duty that would not be rewarded by a portion of the tips. That's
              right,
              along with paying pisspoor wages, Etta and the old man kept all the - very likely considerable -
              gratuities.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the conclusion of my third shift I privately asked the lead cook what he thought were I to decide to
              stay on.
              He laughed derisively, and told me it was my life, my decision. I found his response curious since my
              decision
              would have a definite impact on his life as well, but merely shrugged off his sarcasm and did not respond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I met with the owners. They were happy with my work and wished me to continue. They even told me that
              before long I would likely be
              outperforming the lead cook. They were both really quite
              nice and
              had built a solid, impressive business. But the negatives - the travel time and expense, the unfair money
              distribution, the inevitable, and unnecessary, daily stress - I just couldn't agree to for 12 bucks an
              hour.

            <p><b>2nd</b></p>
            <p>
              A short time after I was hired on at an upscale rustic eatery in Duvall, Washington, that served lunch,
              dinner
              and breakfast on the weekends. There was indoor and outdoor seating, a spacious, well equipped kitchen
              line and
              prep area, as well as open, night pizza station.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the interview, prior to my being brought on, the owners - yet again a husband and wife - asked me
              to
              detail my culinary strengths and preferences. I openly and honestly said I was best at dinner, good at
              lunch,
              and to keep me away from cooking breakfast, for which I had little experience, and disliked both the work
              and
              early hours. The wife seemed sympathetic and inclined to agree to my wishes. But the husband, a doltish,
              opinionated blabbermouth, insisted I needed to learn all the kitchen duties, and that I would eventually
              be scheduled for breakfast. I wanted the job and so did not object. But
              insisted that their restaurant would be far better served with me cooking dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
              They started me out on a lunch shift. With no prior training, no other cook, and only a menu and friendly
              waitress to guide me along. Fortunately it was not busy, and with the waitress's help I was able to fumble
              through the few orders without any customer complaints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly after I was scheduled for the night pizza shift. Another cook was working the line, and the idea
              was
              that he would show me the basics of the pizza station. However, an early rush of customers prevented him
              from
              this. And yet again I was working blind. I did not know how to correctly adjust the oven temperature
              (which was
              set too low), and so when I received my first order I spent the next 45 minutes or so trying to look like
              I knew
              what I was doing, as the to-go pizza customer looked directly at me with an increasingly disgusted
              expression.
              After a shift or two more, however, I got the hang of it, started to enjoy the work, and made some marked
              improvements on the pizzas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not too long after I was scheduled to work both Saturday and Sunday breakfast. The shifts started at 6
              which
              meant I would need to get up at 4:30 in order to give me enough time to get ready and take the 30 minute
              or so
              commute. Being a committed night guy, this also meant I would probably get only 2 hours sleep; which
              turned out
              to be an accurate, if not a bit generous, assumption.

              It was precisely the sort of kitchen labor I despise. Mixing big tubs of pancake batter, eggs and milk for
              french toast, and buscuit goo. Pre-cooking sheet pans of bacon and sausage. Slicing ham, dicing peppers.
              Blah,
              blah. And all done with a 2-hours'-sleep lousy attitude. Ameliorating the circumstances to at least a
              tolerable
              level was my breakfast-cook partner, "Esteban", an easy-going, efficient Mexican whom I like a great deal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike lunch, breakfast at the place was very a busy affair. Thus between 8AM and noon a truly sickening
              amount
              of pancakes and french toast had been flipped, eggs cracked and flat-topped, omelets filled, buscuits
              puffed and
              pork products re-heated. And all done with a 2-hours'-sleep lousy attitude.

              Heading back to the dish pit, there were several towering edifices of filthy, grease-congealed breakfast
              dishes
              awaiting to be scraped, scoured, sanitized and rinsed <em>by the cooks.</em> And worse, more - far more -
              kept
              coming. Hand and tray delivered by teenaged busboys who would crash them down hither-and-yon among us,
              before
              scurrying off to the wait station to gobble down sausages, slurp soda and chitchat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only someone as stupid as that blabbermouth husband owner could make such a ridiculous
              employee work arrangement, I thought at the time, and often since.
              But I needed money, which was fair at the place, so I stuck around. Not, however, for long. Mostly doing
              pizzas
              and lunches, and I believe one more weekend of breakfast hell. It was kind of a shame because it was
              (still is,
              I think) a good business. And were I to have worked and mastered the night line station, I would have
              served it
              well.

              <p>
                One sunny summer day I was walking around downtown Kirkland and spotted a little Italian bistro right on
                the
                waterfront. I had recently left the Duvall business and wanted to get back to work, so decided to go in
                and
                inquire about a job. I was taken to the owner - a portly 30-something Italian - who asked if I had
                experience
                with Italian food, to which I answered in the affirmative. He told me to come back the following day at
                4 to
                help with dinner service.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I only worked one night at the place, there really isn't much of note to recount. Along with
                the
                owner, there was a friendly and helpful fellow named Nor, who I believe was middle eastern, and seemed
                to know
                what he was doing. There was also a younger Italian guy, who apparently was the owner's nephew; and who,
                for
                whatever bizarre reason, tried to convince me that one of Washington State's wealthiest areas, Kirkland,
                had
                an alarmingly high rate of poverty.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a cute place and had a wonderful view of Lake Washington. But when the customers began rolling in
                the
                two stations at which I was assissting - lead line with the owner and pizza with the nephew - both
                descended
                into chaos. Yet again it seemed I was expected - at least by the owner - to know and properly execute
                his menu
                with zero training. And he seemed quite irritated by my fumbling ineptitude and inability to get things
                right
                on the first try. At the evening's conclusion I told Nor of this. Nor had worked a separate pantry
                position
                and was unaware of the collapse of the two other stations. He was openly surprise and disgusted at his
                boss's
                lack of "new guy" understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following afternoon I got a call from the owner asking me to come in. Apparently he either wasn't
                too
                pissed off at my first night's performance, or was woefully deficient of help. Either way I wasn't
                interested,
                and declined.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few days later I popped into a wine store that was adjacent to the Italian place. While
                there,
                out of curiosity, I asked the employee what he thought of the neighboring Italian restaurant, and if he
                would
                recommend it.
              </p>
              <p>"If I were you", he said, "I wouldn't go there. The place has <em>issues.</em>"</p>

                Soon after I received a Craigslist response from
                a man
                who was chef and co-owner (with his wife) of a restaurant in neighboring Bothell called "Tandem."

              <p>He had received my resume, and was impressed with my experienced. As we spoke on the phone to sort out
                the
                first day details, I couldn't help but notice that his wife was listening and providing, in the
                background, answers to most, if not all, of my inquieries.</p>
              <p>Me: "Fine, you'd like me to come in Wednesday, what time?" </p>

                Tandem was nice. A two storey bicycle-themed bistro with a small, euro-based menu and an emphasis on
                wine and
                cheese. The chef, a tallish soft-spoken man of about 50, had long blond ponytail-trussed hair, and we
                got
                along quite well from the start. It was an open (visible to diners) kitchen and rather small, but clean
                and
                orgnized. The small dining areas, two on the first floor and one on the second, were mostly wood with an
                assortment of ecclectic rural/rustic-type decorations in addition to the aforementioned bicycle
                paraphernalia.
                It was exactly the kind of dining environment that I like most, and was glad to be working there.

              <p>
                The wife took care of all things wine and dining room. Unlike her husband chef, she was short, brusque
                and
                somewhat abrasive - quite like the way she sounded in the background over the phone. But the first
                couple of
                nights that I worked there were slow - perhaps 10 diners each night - and I had little interaction with
                her.

            <p>
              In contrast to my past two jobs, I was easing nicely into the cooking program at Tandem during those first
              two
              nights. Though I had not been particularly challenged, the chef was candidly pleased by my work, and in
              due
              course told me that I would be paid at the top end the business could afford. From
              the
              point of view of both he and I, it increasingly seemed like I would be an excellent fit.
              <p>
                A couple things did come out, though, which made me a bit uneasy. He told me he had had a string of
                cooks walk
                out on him, and hoped that I would be able to deal with some of the job's more stressful moments. Having
                cooked in many high-intense situtions, I said (and believed) that I could likely handle it at Tandem.
              </p>
              <p>
                He also told me that his wife, at times, could be "brutal". Hmmmm. Well, I just hoped she would give me
                time
                to get the job down. Because once I did I was pretty sure she'd have little to complain about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon starting my third day as I walked through the bistro, I heard a voice
                behind:
              </p>
              <p><em><b>"I need to talk to you."</b></em></p>
              <p>
                I turned and was standing just a few feet from the wife.
              </p>
              <p>"Yes?"</p>
              <p>"Listen, you are working in an open kitchen. You are visible to customers. Sometimes <em>very
                  important</em>
                customers. Sometimes laywers, doctors, or prominent business owners. <em>Sometimes the mayor of
                  Bothell.</em>
                You need to remember that when you are cooking here. <em><b>You need to look like you enjoy it
                    here.</b></em>
                Our customers are important and we want them to return. And if they see a cook <em>that looks like he's
                  in a
                  bad mood, or having a bad day, <b>or doesn't like his job,</b></em> they just might not come back.
                <em>Get

              In utter astonishment, I wandered into the kitchen. Then muttered to the chef that I thought I
              <em>was</em>
              enjoying it there.
            </p>
            <p>"Yeah," he said, "you're kinda like me. More of a serious personality."</p>
            <p>
              I said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Just don't overthink it," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I wasn't <em>over-</em>thinking it. I was thinking of the bizarreness of it. The <em>lunacy</em> of
              it. I
              thought I was hired to cook. But apparently I was to play the grinning imbecil as well. Silly me. Or
              rather, non
              silly me. At least not silly enough. <em>A string of cooks walked out</em>... And of course I understood:
              No
              self-respecting cook - or any type of employee - would <em>ever</em> put up with with such irrational
              berating.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found a scratch pad and pen, scribbled down the hours I had worked with my address, and handed it to the
              chef.
              Though composed, he was clearly irate. I wasn't sure, but I hoped it was because of his wife.
            </p>
            <p>"You just need to take directions, sometimes," he said.</p>
            <p>
              I didn't respond. But thought probably what all who had walked out before me thought: <em>Not from that
                bitch.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              No, I did not get paid the two night's work.

                I suppose if there is any humor to be gleaned from the above, it would be that the wife's abusive staff
                treatment can really have only served to create unneeded difficulties in her business - which is to say
                her
                life. Too bad the majority of problems - which were clearly caused by the wife - likely impacted her

                G.A. Maxwells was a big log cabin-type structure, located right off 1-5, in Marysville, Wa. The large,
                main
                dining area had an ancient, filthy carpet, dingy booths, a view of the ample front kitchen, and all
                line
                grunts toiling therein.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I strode across the dining room, en route to my interview with the business's Korean owners - yet
                again a
                husband and wife - the first cook I made eye contact with was Tyler, working the fryer. Tyler was a
                skinny
                dude, pale skin, red hair, jutting red beard, thick-framed glasses, and an f-you gaze.
              </p>
              <p>
                I spotted the owners - Mr. and Mrs. Cho - and took a seat at their booth. Nice folks. The smiling,
                slightly
                pudgy wife was especially friendly. They told me Maxwells was a fairly recent acquisition of theirs,
                along
                with three liquor stores purchased from the state of Washington. They said they were planning on
                upgrading the
                stores by including a bigger selection of fine wine, and maybe even a cafe in one or two. From my
                resume, they
                knew I had retail wine experience, as well as being a seasoned cook, and thought I could be
                the
                wine guru for the stores. And then help out with the eateries when the time came. But in the mean time,
                they
                wanted a kitchen manager for Maxwells. A Korean associate of theirs, Lance Kwan, was running the show,
                and
                wasn't happy with the quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                I liked the idea of doing the wine program at the liquor stores. And even though dreaded the notion of
                trying
                to manage a huge dump like Maxwells, agreed to do it, hoping I wouldn't be stuck there too long.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned fast that Maxwells was a deeply disfunctional enterprise, with a bad spirit.

                And threw a fit and flat out refused when told to leave. Not sure exactly how long it took or how it was

              The cooks that I had met during those first couple of days all seemed a noxious brew of disgruntledness,
              derangement and dispair. I suspected all were frequent users. And the two main dishwashers - a lanky
              teenaged
              Quilceda native, and a large, bald, fierce-looking dude - both inclined towards death metal in the back
              kitchen.
              And liked it loud.

            <p>
              The guy who sort of managed the dining room was a Marysville local who was thoroughly burned out and
              almost always foul-tempered. And for whatever weird reason liked to cop the accent and attitude
              of an
              Italian mob thug, especially when pissed off. Which, to restate, was almost always. Most of the waitresses
              were heavily face-painted,
              gossipy
              lifers: bitchy, impatient, and often at war with the all male kitchen. Lance, the Korean managing
              partner, had, some years prior, a bad skiing accident. The result of which made it look like he was
              always
              shitfaced and the verge of toppling over when he walked. Many a time I readied myself to dart behind him
              as he
              appeared to be going down, only to watch him deftly swing back a leg, pop upright again, and regain
              equalibrium.

              If the staff was disfunctional, and it surely was, the restaurant was sheer disaster. <em>All</em> of the
              equipment, from the walk-in fridge to the frying pans, was faulty, old, and mangy as a ghetto mutt. The
              commercial dishwasher was constantly on the fritz, hence there was nearly always a big unsightly pile of
              unwashed dishes and filthy pot and pan accumulation.

              After lunch service the front line area was inevitably covered in discarded food-trash, dropped bar
              towels,
              paper products, and cooking utensils. And on a depressingly regular basis, sewage would bubble up through
              the
              drain pipes and get mashed into the general muck below. It disgusted me so much I bought a pair of
              super-thick soled shoes (second hand of course) in order to distance myself, however inadaquately, from
              all the
              trampled floor filth.

              On my third day, I was introduced by Lance to a cook who would soon become my sous chef. With the amusing
              name
              (I thought) of Ben Dehoe, I liked him from the start. Prior to meeting Ben, Lance had described him to
              me as
              having a "quiet" personality. Which really wasn't the case. Lance did not speak english well, and what he
              probably meant was that Ben was a really good sort. And that he was. Happy, grounded, sober - really
              quite the
              opposite of the other cooks. And he knew the line, and the War and Peace-lengthed menu better than I ever
              would.
              We worked well together, he as lead and I doing saute. We put up good food and in spite of all the other
              crap to deal with, when working with Ben, I tended to enjoy my job.

              Another check in the Maxwell's pro column (for a time) was the weekend fry cook, Sammy. A Tijuana native,
              Sammy
              was likable, worked fast, and put up nice plates. When Ben, Sammy and I worked together, things generally
              went
              smoothly. At some point, however, Sammy started arriving both late and drunk. The fact that he would be
              drunk didn't really
              bother
              me, because his work was still good. But due to much of the restaurant's clientel being elderly and
              dining early, Sammy coming late irked me a great deal. Since it was I who had to cover for him during the
              "blue
              hair" rush; and I really hate fry cooking.

            <p>
              A couple months into the job, I met with the bankrolling owners (the Chos) to discuss the upcoming wine
              business. They had lovely cards made for me with my name and position: "Director of Wine Operations." They
              told
              me they were going to start off with a wine-tasting event at a store on Bainbridge Island, and wanted me
              to
              oversee the event. I was delighted. I had lived for a year on Bainbridge and loved it there. And thought
              perhaps
              that this might instigate a (hopefully soon) departure from Maxwells.
            </p>
            <p>
              I arrived to the store and was met by a consummately unpleasant female employee, who knew nothing of wine,
              did
              nothing in preparation of the event, and offered no help in getting it organized. I dashed off to a nearby
              store
              to get the few things needed - water pitcher, spitoon, etc. - and got back before people arrived. When I
              gave
              the receipt to the employee she refused to reimburse me. Very curious.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was an Italian tasting, hosted by an attractive blonde Italian gal, and everything went generally
              fine.
              About
              halfway through, however, I got a call from Mr Cho. He was watching remotely from a hidden camera, wanted
              to
              know how things were going, and thought I should be interacting more with the participants. While owning
              my
              former business, I had organized many tasting events, and knew well that it was the person pouring and
              discussing the wines that the attendees (and potential buyers) wished to interact with. Especially when an
              attractive female poured the wine and most in attendance were male, as was the case of the current event.
              <em>And I didn't like being spied on, and micromanaged.</em>
              <p>I absolutely could have improved the stores but the wine job - for reasons I never found out - never
                materialized. And after a few more months of slogging through the filth and weirdness of G.A. Maxwells,
                I
                quit.

                Shortly after beginning the sixth job, I told my sister the name of the restaurant. She thought I said
                <em">"Beast</em> on Main," which was just a hair off, but better described the place.

                The location was Main Street, Bellevue, Washington. The menu, upscale European; the decor refined, but
                not
                stuffy; the clientel, rich to super rich.

              <p>After being interviewed by the ex-military head chef, who looked like a white version of Mr. T, but was
                actually pretty easy going, he told me to go to the service kitchen and observe the cooks for a few
                minutes.
                It was a small, cramped line busily occupied by two hispanics, who steadfastly ignored me, and a mid 20s
                white
                guy, who glared at me with steel blue eyes of pure hate.</p>

                My first week I was scheduled to work four 10 hour shifts in the pantry, (apps, salads and desserts).
                The shifts invariably lasted 11-plus hours, and at the week's end I was
                asked
                to work the next 2 nights to fill in for someone who quit. Exhausted, I did not want to, but agreed.

                I was at the time in my late 40's - well past my line-cooking prime - and work at the Beast (as I
                may just
                as well call it) was <em>hard.</em> The second after changing into one's chef jacket in the downstairs
                prep
                area, it was necessary to move at a pace a mere notch below a jog in order to complete one's pre line
                work.
                And then pick it up a bit while transporting one's contained prep work, heavily piled on sheet pans, up
                a
                flight of steep, often slippery stairs. And after which hastily stuff the contents into refridgeration
                stations
                on the service line. Then came the time to <em>really</em> move.

                  Shortly before my employment at the Beast, I had an interview with a chef at another Bellevue
                  restaurant which was owned by a man who had an adjacent wine store. The interview went well, and I was
                  pretty sure I was soon to be hired. Being told the owner was currently in his shop, I decided to check
                  it
                  out, buy a bottle of wine, and hopefully make a favorable first impression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon entering, the owner was occupied with 30-ish guy, who was putting together a multi-case
                  wine
                  order. And order indeed it was, as the young dude
                  barked and
                  dictated his selection commands to the hasselled, and haltingly obsequious senior shop owner. This
                  went on
                  for quite some time, with the owner really quite unable to free himself from the snotty, snobby, nasty
                  and
                  obviously overly-rich punk, due to the high-value sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their transaction finally concluded I politely asked the owner a couple of questions regarding the
                  wine I
                  had selected. He was clearly both agitated and embarrassed by the recent experience, surely feeling
                  the
                  humiliation all the more deeply due to the incident having been witnessed. Witnessed by me. Not really
                  thinking things through, I told the owner of my interview with his restaurant chef. His response was
                  neither
                  agreeable, nor enthusiastic. And of course I did not get the job.

                  I grew up on the eastside of Lake Washington and spent several years living in
                  Bellevue. It was a great place to grow up. Because of the tremendous tech boom, the entire area has
                  developed into a series of glittering, bloated suburbs with two distinct classes: The rich, and those
                  who
                  serve them.

              Once all the prep was hauled upstairs and put in good order (an absolute necessity in a busy restaurant,
              and
              known in the french <em>mis en place</em>) the food tickets would usually start rolling in, sometimes in
              astonishing amounts, right away.
            </p>
            <p>
              My usual working nights were Wednesday through Saturday, and on these nights the pantry station was run by
              two
              cooks, until business calmed down a bit. The guy I normally worked with was the restaurant's sous chef,
              Roland Olber-something-or-other.
              Roland was a Swiss native, energetic, compentant and about my age. Once I caught on, which out of
              necessity did
              not take long, we handled the busy station well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working broiler (Ernie) and saute (Baldi) were the two hispanics - Mexicans to be more precise - that I
              saw
              when
              first observing the kitchen. For my initial couple of weeks Ernie and Baldi, each long-termers, did
              nothing to assist when Roland was off line and I needed help (and a new guy will inevitably
              need
              help). And never missed an opportunity to jeer, mock, badger and laugh when I screwed something up, (which
              a guy
              will of course do when new.)
            </p>
            <p>
              But taking the punishment in stride it wasn't long before I learned the ropes, and the
              badgering
              diminished. And I suspect in large part because I was able to chat with them in passable Spanish,
              something of a
              friendship began to develope. Actually a frienship with nearly all
              the
              hispanic staff as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there were <em>gringos</em> who just couldn't take it. Usually they'd put up with non-stop mockery and
              belittlement for a week or two, until one day not coming back.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most egregious example of this that I witnessed was one night when Roland was off, and I was stuck
              working with a new
              guy
              named Jeff. Jeff was middle-aged, greying and timid, and came from a prep background. I
              don't
              think Jeff had any line exprience. And between the two, there's a <i>big</i> difference. As always, just
              shortly
              after opening for dinner, the salad and appetizer orders began roaring in. With Jeff being new, and having
              no
              line experience to fall back on, things quickly fell into disarray .
            </p>

            <h4>Six Jobs 14</h4>
            <p>
              Then a large order for raw osters came in which Jeff did not know how to shuck, so of course my attention
              was,
              for several minutes, diverted to the task. Meanwhile the station was being relentlessly bombarded by
              orders.
              I tried my best to talk Jeff through at least getting the salads tossed and plated, but the intensity soon
              broke
              him. Beginning to perceptibly quiver, he shut down and stopped working. And his eyes darted about in
              pained
              confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finishing the oysters, I began maniacally racing through the accumulated food orders until
              catching up.
              But even as things calmed, Jeff remained traumatized.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I began the earlier pantry shift, at around ten I was told to clock out. And Jeff was to finish the
              station solo.
              I knew there would still be orders coming in. And knew also that Jeff would have no clue. Last I saw, he
              was
              staring blankly at the printer as a couple of orders rolled in. Of course aware of his meltdown the
              Mexicans' mockery was savage, and they looked to him with undesguised disgust. And steadfastly refused to
              help.
            </p>
            <p>
              What was done to Jeff
              was
              really quite unfair. Nor, for that matter, was being teamed up with someone so new and inexperienced fair
              to me.
              Just how things rolled at the Beast. Jeff did not return.

              After making enough money to return to Colombia I gave my notice at the Beast and returned to Sabaneta. With a couple part time employees, my wife Julieta and her son were running the restaurant well enough to allow me to spend most of my time at leisure rather than engaged in restaurant labor, a nice change of which I was happy to take advantage. But soon enough the money ran low and boredom set in, so back to the states I went in search of another job.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first prospect I had was a bistro in the heart of lovely Woodinville's Wine Country, name unremembered. I worked the kitchen one night with with a group of friendly Mexicans, but apparently did not impress, and was not called to return. The only thing of note was an attractive 30-something waitress who upon our first encounter, rather than utter a mundane  "hello" or "hi, I'm Sue," introduced herself by saying "I swallow." An apparent preference I was not to confirm. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after I was interviewed at a swank hotel/restaurant in downtown Kirkland. The interview having gone well, I was then given a tour of the large, industrial kitchen, which was nice enough but peopled by a crew of unsmiling burnouts, likely embittered by overwork and pathetic pay. And upon being offered a ball-busting line cooking job at $13 an hour, I just couldn't see myself among them and declined.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately I was staying at my sister's house rent free and so wasn't burning through the little cash I had on an expensive eastside (of Lake Washington) rental, hence could afford to pass on absurdly unfair job offers. Then while perusing ads for cook jobs on Craigslist I saw an offer which appeared surprisingly reasonable. Promising 40 hour work weeks, no nights and paid holidays for $750 a week, the job was at the University of Idaho, in Moscow. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I immediately Responded to the ad, and then received a call withing an hour or so by a fellow named Heath who was a manager for a company called Greek House Chefs. Heath liked my resum&eacute;, and told me that with my experience the job, cooking for a frat house of about 20 students, would be a piece of cake. And it was. The work really amounted to only about 30 hours a week, was appreciated by the students, and twice a month money was deposited into my account untaxed. Fair dinero, and unquestionably the easiest cook job I'd ever had. I felt like a work horse at last plow untethered and allowed to graze the pasture. Then shortly after a 10 day paid Thanksgiving break, the frat house, Delta Sigma Phi, was involved in a sexual abuse scandal and ordered closed. Oh well.
